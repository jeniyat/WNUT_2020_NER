Viral DNA Miniprep Procedure
Infect 60 mL of chlorella with 200 L of viral single plaque isolates.
Incubate the samples at 25 C for 24-72 hours, with continuous light and shaking.
Centrifuge 30 mL of the lysates in the Sorvall SS34 rotor at 5,000 rpm (3,000 rcf), 5 min, 4 C.
Save the supernatants.
Save the unused portion of the lysates.
Add 10 % NP-40 (or Triton X-100) to the lysate supernatants to a final concentration of 1 %.
Centrifuge the material in Beckman Ti50.2 rotors at 15,000 rpm (~27,000 rcfmax), 75 min, 4 C.
Discard the supernatants.
Resuspend the virus pellets with 1.0 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2.
Transfer 350 L of the resuspended virus to 1.5 mL screw-cap microfuge tubes and adjust the final volume to 500 L with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2.
Add 8.8 L of DNAse I and mix.
Incubate at room temperature for 60 min.
Add 6.0 L of 500 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 to the samples and mix.
Add 56.6 L of proteinase K and 29.0 L of 10 % Na sarcosyl and mix.
Incubate the samples at 60-65 C for 60 min.
Add 300 L of buffer-saturated phenol and 300 L of CHCl3 : Isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the tubes.
Mix by inversion.
Centrifuge in the microfuge at maximum speed for 5 min at 4 C.
Remove the upper aqueous layers to clean tubes.
Add 600 L of CHCl3 : Isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the tubes.
Mix by inversion and centrifuge for 5 min at 4 C in the microfuge.
Remove the upper aqueous layers to clean tubes and repeat the CHCl3 : Isoamyl alcohol extraction 1X.
Place the last extraction into 2.0 mL microfuge tubes.
Add 66 L of 3 M NaOAc to each tube.
Precipitate the DNAs with 2X volumes (approximately 1350 L) of 100 % EtOH.
Mix well and hold at -20 C overnight.
Centrifuge the tubes in the microfuge for 10-15 min at 4 C to pellet the DNAs.
Discard the supernatants.
Wash the DNA pellets 1X with 1000 L of 70 % EtOH in the microfuge for 5 min at 4 C.
Dry the pellets briefly (10-15 min) in the vacuum desiccator or the speed vac (5 min) to remove the EtOH.
Resuspend the DNAs with approximately 60 L of 1X TE buffer.
If the DNA doesn t go into solution overnight, centrifuge in the microfuge for 15 min at 4 C and remove the supernatants to clean tubes.
Discard the pellets.
Store the DNAs at 4 C.
