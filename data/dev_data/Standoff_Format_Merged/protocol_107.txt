Transformation of competent E.coli cells with plasmid DNA
Thaw the appropriate amount of competent cells on ice.
Pre-chill the required number of empty 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.
Pipette 50 l aliquots of cells into the pre-chilled tubes.
Add 5-10 l of a ligation reaction mix or 5 ng of pure plasmid DNA to each tube.
Mix gently!
Incubate the tubes of ice for 30 min.
Heat shock the cells for 45 sec at 42 C.
Place the tubes immediately on ice for at least 2 min.
Add 800 l of SOC medium to each tube and incubate for 1 hour at 37 C.
Transfer the cultures to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and spin for 1 min at 6000 rpm.
Remove 800 l of the supernatant and resuspend the pellet.
Plate out the suspension on a LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic.
Incubate the plates overnight at 37 C.
