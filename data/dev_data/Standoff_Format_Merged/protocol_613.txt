A Non-Interfering (NI) Protein Assay Perform assays at room temperature.
Use 2ml tubes for assay.
Prepare a set of protein standards using the supplied BSA or Non-Animal Protein Standard as indicated in the table below : Tube # 123456Protein Standard [ 2mg/ml ] (l) 048122025Protein (g) 0816244050.
Add 1-50 l of the protein samples to be assayed to 2ml tubes.
Add 0.5ml UPPA I to each tube and vortex.
Incubate for 2-3 minutes at room temperature.
Add 0.5ml UPPA II to the tubes and vortex.
Centrifuge the tubes at maximum speed (~10,000xg) for 5 minutes to pellet the precipitated protein.
Decant off the supernatant, return the tubes to the centrifuge as before, quickly pulse to spin down residual liquid and remove with a pipette.
Add 100 l Copper Solution (Reagent I) and 400 l deionized water to the tubes and vortex until the protein precipitate pellet dissolves.
Using 1ml pipette, rapidly shoot 1ml Reagent II directly into each tube containing Reagent I plus DI Water and immediately mix it by inverting the tubes.
Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 minutes and then immediately read absorbances at 480nm against DI water.
Plot absorbance against protein concentration and determine protein concentrations of unknowns.
