Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel using a razor blade, scalpel or other device and transfer it into a 15 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Add 3 volumes of ADB to each volume of agarose excised from the gel.
Incubate at 37-55 C for 5-10 minutes until the gel slice is completely dissolved.
Transfer the melted agarose solution to a Zymo-Spin Column in a Collection Tube.
Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds.
Discard the flow-through.
Wash # 1 : Add 200 l of DNA Wash Buffer to the column.
Wash # 1 : Centrifuge for 30 seconds.
Discard the flow-through.
Wash # 2 : Add 200 l of DNA Wash Buffer to the column.
Wash # 2 : Centrifuge for 30 seconds.
Discard the flow-through.
Add 6 l DNA Elution Buffer or water directly to the column matrix.
Place column into a 1.5 ml tube and centrifuge for 30-60 seconds to elute DNA.
