Th9 Polarization of Mouse CD4+ Cells
Harvest lymph nodes (superficial cervical, mandibular, axillary, inguinal, and mesenteric) from mice.
Tease lymph nodes through a sterile 70- m nylon cell strainer to obtain single-cell suspensions in IMDM containing 10 % FCS (complete medium).
Resuspend cells in complete medium and use your favorite method to isolate CD4+ cells.

On day 0, coat 60 15 mm of plastic petri dishes with anti-mouse CD3, clone 145-2C11 (5 g/ml).
Incubate at 37 C for 2 hours or 4 C overnight.
Aseptically decant antibody solution from the plate.
Wash plate 3 times with sterile PBS.
Discard liquid.
Plate CD4+ cells at 10 x106/5 ml/dish.
Culture cells for 3 days in the presence of anti-mouse CD28, clone 37.51 (5 g/mL), recombinant human TGF- 1 (10 ng/mL), recombinant mouse IL-4 (10 ng/mL), recombinant mouse IL-2 (20 ng/ml), and anti-mouse IFN-, clone XMG1.2 (10 g/mL).
On day 3, wash cells once and then restimulate in complete medium with 500 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/mL ionomycin, in the presence of monensin for 6 hours.
After harvesting, the cells are ready for staining..
