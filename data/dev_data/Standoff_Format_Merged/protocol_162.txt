Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis (E0554)
Assemble the following reagents in a thin-walled PCR tube.
Transfer to a thermocycler and perform the following cycling conditions :
Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Thaw a tube of NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli cells on ice.
Add 5 l of the KLD mix from the `` KLD Section '' above to the tube of thawed cells.
Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix.
Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock at 42 C for 30 seconds.
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Pipette 950 l of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Incubate at 37 C for 60 minutes with shaking (250 rpm).
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
Spread 50-100 l onto a selection plate.
Incubate overnight at 37 C
