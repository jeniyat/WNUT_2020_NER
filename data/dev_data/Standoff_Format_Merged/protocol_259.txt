Ligation of Sticky Ends with T4
Thaw the T4 DNA Ligase Buffer and resuspended at room temperature.
Set up the following reaction mixture at room temp:10x, T4 DNA Ligase Buffer ; 2 ul, Vector DNA ; 0.020, pmol.
Insert DNA, 0.060 pmol ; Nuclease-free Water to 20 ul ; T4 DNA Ligase, 1 ul.
Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.
For sticky ends, incubate at 22 C for 10 minutes.
Heat inactivate at 65 degrees C for 10 minutes.
Chill on ice and transform 1-5 l of the reaction into 50 l competent cells.
