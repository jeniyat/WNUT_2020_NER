Cas9 Expression and Purification Protocol
Start starter culture (containing amp & chlor) from a glycerol stock.
If there s no glycerol stock, transform and plate Rosetta cells and pick colonies.
Reserve shaker as needed Make Terrific Broth and autoclave as needed.
The media should contain MgCl2 and glycerol.
Preheat shaker to 37 CAdd ampicillin (100 g/L) and chloramphenicol (35 g/mL) to the media.
Remove small sample of media to use as blank later
Measure O D.600 of starter culture (may have to dilute 1:10 to get reading 1.0).
Add enough to each flask so that O D.600 of flask 0.1 (~5 ml).
Shake (250 rpm) for ~4 hrs until A600 1.0 check regularly starting at ~2 hours.
Add IPTG to cultures to 0.5 mM ; change shaker temp to 16 C ; leave cultures in cold room while shaker cools down.
Shake (250 rpm) at 16 C overnight (~16 h).
Pre-chill high-speed centrifuge to 4 C.
Collect cultures and pour into 1 L jars.
Spin using JLA-9.1000 rotor at 4000 G for 15
Prepare appropriate volume of Lysis Buffer (~60 ml per 1 L culture grown) and add 1 M TCEP (pH 7.5) stock to 1 mM.
Thoroughly resuspend pellets in Lysis Buffer and combine.
Freeze.
(No flash-freeze necessary.)
Using a 60 mL syringe fitted with a 21 gauge (green) needle, pass the solution into a new container.
Homogenize : Flush system with water, and then with lysis buffer.
Pass sample through at no pressure, then slowly increase air pressure.
Pass through twice at pressure.
For instructions on homogenizer use, see Ariana, Nick, Frederick, or Luke.
Spin down homogenate in balanced Oakridge tubes (33 mls/tube).
Spin at 18,000 g for 30.
Start the step below.
During the above spin, set up peristaltic pump (P-1).
Run water through pump to remove air.
Attach 2 5 mL HisTrap (Fast Flow) columns in tandem (use wet connections throughout).
Flow 25 mL Lysis Buffer to equilibrate columns.
For 6L of prep, set up a second peristalitic pump and load additional HisTrap columns in parallel.
After the spin is complete, combine supernatants and keep the container on ice.
Take 20 L sample for gel, and run the sample through column at 3 ml/min (4 on the dial).
Collect flowthrough in clean vessel in case binding fails.
Run through 100 ml (10CV- scale all of these up if changing CV) of lysis buffer.
Collect sample from flowthrough for SDS-PAGERun through 100 mL of wash buffer at room temperature.
take sample from flowthroughRun through 100 ml of lysis buffer.
Take sample from the output for SDS-PAGE
Label 10 15 mL conical tubes E1 E10.
Elute.
Begin flowing 50 mL of elution buffer, and collect 5 mL in tube E1.
Stop the pump and wait for 5-10.
Resume the flow and collect nine more 5 mL fractions in tubes E2 10.
Save the fractions on ice and take a sample from each for SDS-PAGE.
Spec each sample from tubes E1 E10 and record the results.
Pool all fractions with an estimated concentration > 1 mg/mL.
Take a sample for SDS-PAGE.
Calculate rough estimate of yield in mgs (assuming 1 O D.280 = 1 mg/ml).
Add one 200 l aliquot of 2 mg/ml TEV protease per 40 mg of eluted material (1 mg TEV per 100 mg Cas9).
Incubate overnight (16 h) at 4 C.
For especially large volumes, gently mix during this step.
Use pump P-1 to run 0.2 M NaOH over 2 5 mL HiTrap Heparin HP columns connected in tandem for 30 to remove endotoxin.
Wash with 10 mL H2O as rinse.
Take sample of TEV-digested material.
Pre-chill centrifuge to 4 C.
Concentrate sample (Amicon Ultra, 100 kDa MWCO) at 4 C, 4000 g until the total volume is 2 ml (per 6 L prep - if prep is 6 L, perform additional buffer exchange via dilution w/ A to reduce [ salt ] before loading).
Add TCEP to 1 mM for Ion Exchange Buffers A and B
Make 3 50ml aliquots of A.
Run 50 mL A over heparin columns to equilibrate.
Once protein is concentrated to ~2 mL, take out 2 l sample for SDS-PAGE and add the rest to 50 mL A.
also take a sample of sample of the flow-through.
Run the sample over heparin columns & post-wash w/ 50 mL A (can perform no wash FPLC program if this step is performed ; can also let the standard FPLC program wash with A).
Meanwhile, set up FPLC.
Put line A1 into buffer A and B1 into buffer B (250 mL each).
Run setup A B program.
Once the sample is loaded onto the columns, bring it to the FPLC.
Put 2 96-well blocks into the fraction collector & let it sense their location.
Follow the FPLC protocol for ion exchange to connect the column & prepare the system.
Run Heparin_5ml-up-flow program (~90).
After the run : remove the blocks, decide on peak, take samples of every other fraction (and any unexpected peaks) to run on SDS-PAGE.
Combine chosen fractions and refrigerate overnight.
NaOH wash Superdex 200 column as needed (0.2 M, 30 contact time) and equilibrate into Gel Filtration Buffer (500 mL in bottle, double check waste container).
Equilibration takes about 2 hrs.
Concentrate chosen fractions down to 2 mL per 6 L prep ; when removing sample from Amicon concentrator, rinse filter w/ GF buffer.
Pre-chill microcentrifuge.
Spin down the 2 mL sample in eppendorf tube (s) at max speed for 5 to pellet any precipitate.
Take 1 l sample from for SDS page analysis from the bottom of the concentrator
Load sample into 3ml syringe using low gauge needle.
Bring the sample to the FPLC.
Run the manual load program, put one 96-well block into fraction collector.
Flush import valve by injecting a few mL of buffer.
Then screw in your syringe and manually load sample, injecting at a rate of 1 mL/min (6 seconds per 100 L).
Next start the run (~2 h).
It s OK to stop after peak is fully eluted (at ~80 mL).
Remove block from fraction collector.
Take samples of peak fractions (especially upstream edge of main peak) and anything else interesting for SDS-PAGE.
Spec to determine concentration.
Run gel of all samples taken so far.
Based on the results, pool pure fraction.
Aliquot, label with name/date/concentration/amount, and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen.
Consider setting aside dedicated aliquots for endotoxin testing, activity assays, etc.
