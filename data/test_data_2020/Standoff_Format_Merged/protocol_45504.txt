A protocol for rapid detection of the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR diagnostics : SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR
Extract patient RNA following CDC recommendations.
Prepare LbCas12a RNP complexes for the samples to be tested.
One complex for N-gene, E-gene, and RNase P gRNAs is needed for each sample.
Incubate LbCas12a with gRNA to generate RNP complexes for 00:30:00 at 37 C.
Add reporter substrate to final concentration of 500 Nanomolar (nM).
Place reactions On ice until ready to proceed.
On ice, prepare three RT-LAMP reactions, one each for N-gene, E-gene, and RNase P primer sets :
Incubate at 62 C for 00:20:00.
Combine 2 l of the RT-LAMP reaction with 20 l of the LbCas12a RNP
complex with the appropriate gRNA.
Add 80 l 1X NEBuffer 2.1.
Incubate at 37 C for 00:10:00.
Insert Milenia HybriDetect 1 (TwistDx) lateral flow strip directly into reaction.
Allow the lateral flow strip to run for 00:02:00 at Room temperature and observe the result.
Note : The line closest to the sample pad is the control line and the line that appears farthest from the sample pad is the test line (see Figure 1).
A sample with complete cleavage of the reporter molecule may appear to have no signal at the control line.
Figure 1 | SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR has a limit of detection (n=7) of 156-625 copies per 20 l reaction (or 70-300 copies per l input) and generates a clear visible signal on lateral flow strips within 30 minutes sample to result.
