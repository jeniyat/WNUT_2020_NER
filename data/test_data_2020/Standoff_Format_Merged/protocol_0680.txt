High Molecular Weight genomic DNA extraction from Gram-negative bacteria for long reads sequencing (Xanthomonas ssp.)
Inoculate a single bacterial colony into 10 mL of 10 % TSB (i.e. 3g/l) (Fisherbrand, Tryptone Caseine Soy Broth Product Code.12186620).
Cultivate the bacteria for 48h at 28 C under constant agitation (120 rpm).
Heat the lysis buffer for > 30 minutes at 65 C.
Centrifuge 1.8 mL of bacterial culture in a 2 mL tube at 10 000g for 5 minutes.
Discard the supernatant by pouring off the liquid removing all growth media.
Set a P1000 pipette on 900 l and resuspend the bacterial pellet into 900 l of lysis buffer (preheated at 65 C) by pipetting up and down vigorously 10 times (with an uncut P1000 tip).
This step is critical for the yield and it is very important to pipette the complete liquid up and down vigorously so all the liquid enters the pipette tip during mixing.
Apparition of foam is good.
Incubate at 65 C in a dry bath for 20 minutes (invert the tube vigorously 10 times after 10 minutes).
Spin down the tube for 1 second.
Add 4 l of RNAse A 100 mg/ml (QIAGEN, Cat No./ID : 19101).
Mix by inverting the tube 10 times and spin down for 1 second.
Incubate at room temperature (18-23 C) for 10 minutes.
Add 300 l of 5M Potassium Acetate solution (or 1/3 of the lysis buffer volume).
Mix by pipetting vigorously and completely 10 times with a P1000 set on 1000 l and using a P1000 tip cut at 0.5 cm from the tip end (to minimize DNA shearing).
Centrifuge the tube at 10 000g for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Transfer the upper phase into a new 2 mL tube without disturbing the pellet (typically 800 l).
Add the same volume (800 l) of beads solution previously prepared (make sure beads are at room temperature for > 30 minutes and well homogenized via vortexing for approximately 30 seconds).
Incubate on a rotator at 10 rpm for at least 15 minutes at room temperature
Place the tube on a magnetic rack and wait for 3 minutes (until beads are stuck to the wall of the tube and solution becomes clear).
Discard the supernatant by pipetting without taking out any beads.
Add 1 mL of fresh 70 % ethanol.
Close the tube and resuspend the beads by inverting the tube 20 times.
It is very important that the beads are resuspended in ethanol to ensure an efficient wash.
If beads are still stuck to the wall of the tube you can flick the tube to resuspend them.
Put the tube back on the magnetic rack.
At this step, beads move immediately to the wall of the tube.
Remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.
Repeat the steps 20 to 24 to wash the beads one more time.
Spin down the tube to bring all the droplets to the bottom of the tube.
Put the tube back on the magnetic rack and remove all the ethanol with a P200 or P10 pipette.
Let beads air drying for a maximum of 30 seconds or else it can affect the DNA integrity and reduce the yield.
Add 100 l of Elution Buffer (QIAGEN, Cat No./ID : 19086).
Resuspend the beads by flicking the tube (make sure they are not aggregated anymore).
Incubate the tube for 15 minutes at 37 C.
Flick the tube again.
Place the tube on a magnetic rack and wait for the solution to become clear.
This can be time consuming when the gDNA solution is very concentrated (> 200ng/ l).
You can add additional elution buffer or just wait for hours!
Transfer the solution into a new tube.
Check the DNA purity by measuring the gDNA concentration with a Qubit and a Nanodrop.
Qubit/Nanodrop ratio should be around 1.2 (Qubit concentration is higher than Nanodrop concentration for Xanthomonas gDNA)
Typically gDNA concentration is between 50 and 200 ng/ l
A260/A280 ratio should be 1.8 2.
If this ratio is > 2 it is likely that the sample is contaminated by RNA.
RNA contamination also leads to a shift between Qubit and Nanodrop concentrations.
To get rid of RNA, you can follow the additional purification n 1 below (Additional purification 1 : RNA removal starting from step 36)
A260/A230 ratio should be 2 2.2.
If this ratio is < 2 you can follow the purification below (Additional purification 2 : A260/A230 improvement starting from step 43).
Check the DNA integrity by running the sample on PFGE or capillary electrophoresis.
The sample should range from 10-20kb to 100-150kb.
Add 1 l of RNase A 100 mg/ml for 100 l of gDNA solution.
Mix by inverting the tube 10 times.
Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature (18-23 C).
Add 1 volume of beads solution prepared (make sure beads are at room temperature for > 30 minutes and well homogenized via vortexing for approximately 30 seconds).
Check the DNA purity and integrity as in the steps 35-36.
Add 1 volume of beads solution previously prepared (make sure beads are at room temperature for > 30 minutes and well homogenized via vortexing for approximately 30 seconds).
Follow the step 16 to 34.
