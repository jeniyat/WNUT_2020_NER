Cell culture of 7721 or HeLa cells
Prepare RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, USA) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, USA).
Warm medium to 37 and bring 0.1 % trypsin - ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) to room temperature.
Observe cells under microscope to evaluate cell confluency and presence of cell death.
Aspirate out spent medium when the cells reach approximately 90 % confluency, and wash twice with PBS.
Add 1 ml 0.1 % trypsin-EDTA to 10-cm culture dish, and ensure the entire surface of the dish is covered with 0.1 % trypsin-EDTA.
Incubate the cells at 37 for 2 minute.
Observe cells under the microscope until the cells have been fully detached, then aspirate out the 0.1 % trypsin-EDTA.
Add 5 ml medium to the dish, gently pipet the cells, and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
Aspirate out the medium, minding to not disrupt the cell pellet.
Resuspend the cells in 2 ml medium and count with trypan blue.
Seed the cells in 24-well plates at a density of 1x105 cells/500 l.
Culture cells under 5 % CO2, in a 95 % humidified atmosphere at 37.
