Virus Purification by Sucrose Density Gradients
Centrifuge lysate in the Sorvall Lynx 4000 centrifuge at 5,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 C.
Discard the pellets.
Add Triton X-100 to the lysate supernatants for a final concentration of 1 % (from a 10 or 20 % stock).
Centrifuge the lysate in the Sorvall WX Ultra Series ultracentrifuge at 17,000 rpm, 50 min, 4 C.
Discard the supernatants.
Resuspend the virus pellets with a small volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8
Approximately 1.0 mL per 100 mL lysate.
Layer the virus suspension onto 100-400 mg/mL (10-40 %) linear sucrose gradients equilibriated with 50 mM Tris-HCl made in polypropylene tubes (layer approximately 3-4 mL per gradient).
To make sucrose stocks, add 10-40 % sucrose to Tris-HCl and autoclave.
Centrifuge the gradients in the ultracentrifuge at 20,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 C.
The virus will be the major band about 1/2 to 2/3 deep in the gradient.
Remove the virus bands from the gradients with sterile needles and transfer to 30 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes.
Split the virus from 3 gradients between two tubes.
Slowly dilute the virus to the tube volume with 50 mM Tris-HCl.
Centrifuge the tubes in the ultracentrifuge at 27,000 rpm, 3 hours, 4 C.
Resuspend the virus pellets with a small volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl.
Store the virus at 4 C.
Do not freeze.
Filter sterilization using a 0.45 um cellulose acetate filter is recommended.
