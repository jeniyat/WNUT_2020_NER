Diatom Transformation via Bacterial Conjugation
Grow the diatom culture to mid-log phase (8.0E6 cells/ml for Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown on L1 medium or 5.0 E7 cell/ml when grown on BG-11).
We have investigated transformation efficiency throughout the growth curve and found these to be the optimal densities.
On the day of transformation, use the overnight culture to inoculate 50 mL of fresh LB+antibiotic, 1:50 dilution, for each planned transformation
Grow to an OD600 of 0.8 1.0 (37 C with 270 rpm shaking)
This takes 3 4 hours.
During the 3 4 hours when the E. coli culture is growing, measure the Phaeodactylum tricornutum cell concentration with a FlowCam or haemocytometer to calculate the required volume needed to collect 2.5E8 cells for each transformation.
For each transformation, centrifuge 50 mL of E. coli culture and the required Phaeodactylum tricornutum volume at 4000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature
Resuspend E. coli pellet in 500 L of SOC medium
Resuspend P. tricornutum pellet in 500 L of L1 medium
Note : The diatom and E. coli cultures should be centrifuged at around the same time to minimize the amount of time they spend concentrated.
In a 1.5 mL tube, mix 200 l of E. coli cells with 200 l of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells
Negative control : In a 1.5 mL tube, mix 200 l of SOC medium with 200 l of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells
Note : Incubate and treat the negative control plates identically to conjugation plates
Spread the mixture (400 L) on Conjugation Plates.
(0.5x BG-11 with 5 % LB and 1 % agar)
The authors of the original protocol suggested spreading the mixture near, but not touching, the edges of the plate, as this mixture will be scraped and replated in 2 days.
Incubate plates for 90 minutes at 30 C in the dark.
Move plates to light incubator (18 C and 100 mol photons m-2 s-1) for 2 days.
Collect cells by adding 1 mL of L1 medium.
Use a cell scraper to concentrate cells and medium to one side of the plate.
We often add 500 L L1 to collect the majority of the cells from the plate
We then repeat with an additional 500 l L1 to collect the remaining cells
Transfer resuspended cells into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with a P1000 pipette and filter tips.
Spread 200 l of the cell suspension on a Selection Plate.
Incubate at 18 C and 100 mol photons m-2 s-1 until colonies appear.
After a minimum of 8-12 days, untransformed Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells die off, and colonies of transformed cells begin to appear.
In some cases, this can take 3 4 weeks
Alternatively, selection can be done in liquid BG-11 selection medium using eGFP as a reporter and sorted using FACS.un-transformed PteGFP expression.
This protocol was modified based on the original procedure and correspondence with the authors.
