Plant nuclear genomic DNA preps
Pour 300 mL ice-cold NEB complete buffer in a blender.
Work inside a fume hood.
Weight 20 g of kiwifruit leaves, cut any long stems and transfer to the blender.
Homogenize for 30 sec in low setting.
Filtrate homogenate through 4 layers of cheesecloth into a sterile glass cylinder.
Filter again through 4 layers of miracloth into another 500 mL sterile glass cylinder.
Adjust the volume to 294 mL with NEB complete buffer.
Add 6 mL of 25 % Triton X-100 in NEB complete buffer by placing the tip of the pipette on the inside wall of the cylinder, close to the top.
Dispense the solution slowly and rotate the cylinder with your other hand.
You will see the syrup-like solution smear downwards towards the homogenate
Seal cylinder with parafilm and mix very gently by inversion 10-20 times.
Rotate the cylinder every time you mix it.
Aliquot the homogenate into six 50 mL Falcon tubes.
Spin down at 588 rpm (57 g) using the SLA-600 TC rotor at 4-10 C, for 2 min only.
A tiny pellet might be visible.
If no pellet is observed, continue with next step without changing tubes.
Transfer the supernatant to a new set of 50 mL Falcon tubes and spin down at 3308 rpm (1800 g), same rotor, 10 C, 15 min.
Transfer supernatant to a waste container for proper disposal later.
Resuspend each pellet with 50 mL NEB no -mercaptoethanol.
Mix gently by inversion until the pellet is resuspended.
Spin down again as before.
Transfer supernatant to the waste container for proper disposal.
Resuspend each pellet with 5 mL NEB no -mercaptoethanol and collect all pellets into one Falcon tube previously weighted.
Add more NEB no -mercaptoethanol to final volume of 50 mL.
Collect the nuclei by centrifugation.
Weight the tube to find out the total amount of nuclei isolated.
From 20 g of kiwifruit fully developed leaves expect about 0.2 g of nuclei, but this will vary depending on the species and genotype.
Keep the tube on ice.
Depending on the nature of the tissue and the budget, select one of the following methods to isolate the nuclear genomic DNA.
Resuspend 0.2 g of nuclei pellet in 14 mL lysis buffer, mix by inversion, do not vortex.
Add 7 L of RNase A 100 mg/mL.
Mix by inversion.
Incubate 10 min at 37 C with gentle shaking.
Add 1.4 mL 5 M K-Acetate pH 7, mix by inversion.
Add 3.5 mL 100 % Ethanol, vortex at maximum speed for 30 s.
Extract the sample with an equal volume of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol (24:1).
Mix by inversion 10 times, then place the tube horizontally in orbital shaker at room temperature and shake for 5 min, gently.
Spin down at 3000 rpm 10 min at room temperature using a swing bucket rotor.
Transfer the aqueous phase to a new 50 mL Falcon tube.
Add an equal volume of ice cold isopropanol.
Mix by inversion and store at -20 C for 30 min.
Spin down at 3000 rpm for 25 min at room temperature or 10 C.
Discard supernatant and add same volume of 70 % ethanol to wash the pellet.
Let it stand at room temperature for ~ 10 min.
Collect DNA by centrifugation.
Discard the supernatant.
Remove all traces of ethanol with a kimwipe without touching the pellet
Air dry the DNA pellet at room temperature for 20-30 min and add 100-200 L TE buffer pH 7.5.
Tap the bottom of the tube to detach the pellet and let it diffuse slowly at room temperature for a few hours or in the refrigerator overnight.
Avoid vortexing the DNA solution at high speed.
Store the DNA at 4 C.
For long term storage, make numbered aliquots and store at -20 C.
Use DNA aliquots sequentially and avoid freeze/thaw cycles.
Add 3.5 mL of CTAB/NaCl extraction buffer and 80 L Proteinase K to the nuclei pellet and vortex gently to resuspend.
Incubate at 56 C for 1-2 hour without shaking or until all solution is clear.
Add 10 L RNase A 100 mg/mL, mix and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
Add 3.5 mL of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and vortex until an emulsion is obtained.
Separate the phases by centrifugation using a swing bucket rotor, 3000 rpm, at room temperature for 15 min.
If the interphase between the organic and aqueous solutions is not tight, you could centrigue the sample for another 15 min or transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube and add equal volume of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol.
Transfer aqueous phase to a new Falcon tube and add 2 volumes of 100 % ethanol.
Mix gently.
Incubate at -20 C for at least 2 h.
Collect the DNA by centrifugation as explained before (Step 26-30).
Follow the Qiagen DNease Plant Maxi kit instructions with the following modifications : The final pellet of nuclei should be divided into 2 tubes and treat each one as the starting material for one extraction using this kitTo elute the DNA incubate the binding column with 1 mL of AE buffer for 1 h.
Spin down as described in the kit instructions.
Add another mL of AE buffer to the binding column and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.
Spin down again.
Each column/tube will have ~ 2 mL of eluted DNACombine both samples (~ 4 mL) and add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, mix, and add 2 volumes of 100 % ethanol.
Mix.
Store at 4 C or -20 C ovenightCollect, wash and resuspend the pellet as described in steps 26-30The fragment size distribution obtained with this kit is 20-40 kbp.
Check the quality of the ngDNA by absorbance ratios at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm.
Aim for ~1.8 and > 2.0, respectively.
Quantify the ngDNA by fluorescence (Qubit or DeNovix) using a high sensitivity kit.
Make 10-fold serial dilutions and quantify 1-5 L.
Run 100- 200 ng of ngDNA in a standard 1 % agarose gel, stained with Sybr safe.
Use lambda DNA (48.5 kbp) as control
If you have access to a pulse field gel electrophoresis system, run ~ 200 ng against a lambda ladder, intact lambda DNA and 1 kb+ ladder.
