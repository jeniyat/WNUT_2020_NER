SARS-CoV-2 Enrichment Sequencing by Spiked Primer MSSPE method
Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (combined into one tube) were collected from a symptomatic patient meeting case definition for possible infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Extraction of viral nucleic acids from clinical sample was performed with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen # 52906) as described by manufacturer Extracted RNA samples were DNAse-treated using the Zymo DNAse I kit.
The nucleic acid was tested via real-time polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 using both the Drosden and HKU protocols published by the World Health Organization and confirmed positive for COVID-19 on January 27th, 2020.
Ct values for PUI = 24.
RNA was quantified using the Qubit High Sensitivity RNA kit as described by the manufacturer.
Qubit input RNA concentration for PUI = 6.9 ng/uL
Library Preparation was performed with the NEBNext Ultra II non-directional RNA kit.

**Checkpoint : Samples can be stored frozen at -20 C and library prep resumed the next day.
End Repair
Mix all the following by pipetting up and down
30 mins at 20 C
30 mins at 65 C
Adapter Ligation
dilute adaptor to dilution prior to making master mix.
Adaptor concentration depends on the amount of input ; 1:100 dilution for samples < 5ng, 1:25 for input of > 5ng
Add adaptor separately after ligation master mix and ligation enhancer to avoid adaptor dimers.
Thermocycler (heated lid off) :
15 mins at 20 C with heated lid off
Proceed immediately to Bead Purification.
15 mins at 20 C with heated lid off

Add 87uL of room temperature beads (0.9x) to Adaptor Ligation reaction.
Mix well.
Repeat EtOH wash step for a total of 2 times.

USER/Q5 Indexing PCR Mix the following components by pipetting up and down.
Cycling conditions : ** PCR cycles are dependent on the input RNA.
For libraries with < 5ng input, perform 15-19 cycles of PCR.
For 5-20ng input, perform 10-14 cycles of PCR.
For > 20ng input, perform 6-8 cycles of PCR.

** Checkpoint : Libraries are complete, samples can be stored frozen at -20 C until ready for quantification and pooling.
Libraries were quantified by the Qubit High Sensitivity DNA kit and the Agilent High Sensitivity D500 DNA Tapestation assay.
If adapter dimers are found, library should be size selected using a SPRI ratio of 0.8x.
Quantified library is then diluted down to the loading concentration for the iSeq, 100pM.
This value will vary depending on the type of sequencer.
The Illumina iSeq was loaded with 20uL of a 100pM library with a 5 % PhiX spike in.
Metagenomic sequencing results were uploaded onto IDseq.net directly from the Illumina Basespace Sequence Hub.
The open-source cloud-based pipeline analyzed 1.8 million reads.
The majority of reads mapped to the nasal and oral microbiome.
Analyses of the viral components resulted in 3,077 single end reads aligning to the SARS-CoV2 taxon.
Resulting reads from the Betacoronovirus genus were downloaded from IDseq and mapped to the NCBI genome accession number : MN908947.1.
The geneious alignment displayed even coverage across the genome with an average coverage of 14.9x.
One SNP was noted at position 25,654 in ORF3a resulting in a valine to leucine substitution when compared to NCBI accession MN908947.1.
