Calculating burst size
Take the FREE phage average of the time points on the plateau before the burst (A).
Take the FREE phage average of the time points on the plateau after the burst (B).
Subtract A from B ; This is the total burst or new phages released (C).
Divide C by the number of infecting phage (TOTAL phages at T0 minus FREE at T0) ; This is the burst size.
