DNA Extraction Procedure Using SDS
Cut tissue and grind by liquid nitrogen.
Transfer grinded tissue to 15 ml tube.
Add 6ml TEN, 700 l 20 % SDS 56 preheat), 150 l beta mercaptoethanol and 150 l proteinase K, rapidly mix.
Incubate homogenate for 2 h at 56, gently blending for every 5 ~ 10 min.
Cool down to room temperature.
Add an equal volume of Tris saturated phenol and mix.
Centrifuge at room temperature (16) with 14000 RPM for 10 min, then save supernatant.
Add chloroform and isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the supernatant, then mix.
Centrifuge with 14000 RPM for 10 min, save supernatant.
Resuspend nuclei pellet with 0.8 X volume of frozen isopropyl alcohol.
Wash with cold ethanol 75 %.
(1/2).
(2/2).
Let it dry.
Add 200 l TEN and 2 l RNAse (100 mg/ml).
37 for 30 min, incubation period precipitation with Tip dolly, precipitate dissolve completely.
Add buffer (TEN and 200 l 20 % SDS) and 40 l Protease K up to 2 ml.
Incubate for 30 min at 56.
Add chloroform and isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to supernatant, then mix
Centrifuge with 14000 RPM for 10 min, save supernatant.
Wash twice with cold ethanol 75 %.
Add 300 l EB (pH 8.0) to dissolve.
