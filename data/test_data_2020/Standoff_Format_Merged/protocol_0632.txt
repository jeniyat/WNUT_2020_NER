RNA Isolation from Yeast
Centrifuge 10 15 ml of yeast cells in a 15-ml conical tube at 1,500 rcf (room temperature) for 3 min
Decant supernatant and freeze cells in liquid nitrogen.
To frozen cell pellet, add 800 l of acid saturated phenol and 800 l of lysis buffer
Vortex until pellets are in solution.
Place tubes in MultiTherm (should be pre-heated to 65 C)
Vortex at maximum intensity for 45 min at 65 C.
Transfer lysate to RNase-free 2-ml tube
Centrifuge 10 min at max speed in microcentrifuge at 4 C
Transfer top aqueous phase into fresh RNase-free 2-ml tube containing 800 l phenol
Vortex briefly and centrifuge 5 min at 5,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at room temperature
Transfer top aqueous phase into fresh RNase-free 2-ml tube containing 800 l chloroform
Vortex briefly and centrifuge 5 min at 5,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at room temperature
Transfer aqueous phase into fresh RNase-free 2-ml tube.
Add 75 l 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2 (0.1 volume) and ~ 1.8 ml 100 % ethanol (~2.5 volumes)
Place tubes at -20 C to precipitate RNA for > 2 hours (overnight works best).
Next Day Pellet RNA at max speed for 30 min in microcentrifuge at 4 C
Carefully decant supernatant and add 1 ml 70 % EtOH to wash pellet
Centrifuge at max speed for 15 min at 4 C
Remove ethanol using a 1-ml pipette (use RNase-free pipette tips)
Centrifuge briefly (1-2 min) at max speed to collect any residual ethanol to the bottom of the tube and remove that with a 10-ul pipette (use RNase-free pipette tips) ..

Centrifuge briefly (1-2 min) at max speed to collect any residual ethanol to the bottom of the tube and remove that with a 10-ul pipette (use RNase-free pipette tips) ..
Resuspend pellet in 50 l RNase-free TE by pipetting up and down.
