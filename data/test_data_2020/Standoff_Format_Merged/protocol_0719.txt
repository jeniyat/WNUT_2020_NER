Algal nuclei isolation for Nanopore sequencing of HMW DNA
Add BME to premade NIB.
Per sample add BME into premade NIB.
Make 10 % Triton X-100 NIB solution.
Per sample, aliquot NIB prepared in previous step and add Triton X-100.
Cool solutions to on ice.
Set thermomixer to.
Chill centrifuge to.
Chill 50 ml conical tubes (4 per sample) and NIB buffers on ice.
Transfer to of culture to a pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube and centrifuge at for to pellet cells
The amount of culture spun down as well as the centrifugation speed at which cultures are pelleted should be optimized for each organism.
In our experience, the pellet size should be at least the size of a lentil for small (5 m) for our alga.
Discard the supernatant and snap freeze the conical tube in liquid nitrogen for at least
Some organisms will require some type of tissue disruption to lyse cells.
Place cell pellet on ice and add of ice cold NIB
If you know your pellet is not very soluble, only add 1mL of NIB at first and mix by pipetting up and down with a 1mL pipette.
Add remaining 9mL NIB after clumps are broken up.
Mix by slowly pipetting up and down with a 10mL serological pipettor until the mixture is smooth and not clumpy.
Place a 100 m filter on top of a pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube.
Slowly pour the sample through the filter into the clean tube
Use a serological pipettor to wash the filter with of ice cold NIB.
Place a 70 m filter on top of a second pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube.
Place a 40 m filter on top of a third pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube.
(Do not wash with NIB).
Add of ice cold NIB + TritonX solution to filtrate.
Centrifuge at for to pellet nuclei
The speed at which the sample is spun down should be reevaluated for different organims based on genome size.
Discard the supernatant.
Aliquot of the pellet into a clean 1.5ml eppendorf tube.
Add of fresh NIB and of propidium iodide to the tube.
Transfer the stained nuclei to a microscope and confirm presence of fluorescing nuclei under an epifluorescent light
