Mix barcoded libraries to achieve equal representation as desired aiming for a final concentration as recommended by the manufacturer.
After mixing, perform an Ampure bead cleanup if needed to remove any residual PCR primers.
Perform paired-end Illumina sequencing on the barcoded libraries following the manufacturer s instructions.
We align paired-end reads using Bowtie2 version 2.2.5 with options : -- local -- very-sensitive-local -- no-unal -- no-mixed -- no-discordant -- phred33 -I 10 -X 700.
For mapping E. coli carry-over fragments, we also use the -- no-overlap -- no-dovetail options to avoid possible cross-mapping of the experimental genome to that of the carry-over E. coli DNA that is used for calibration.
