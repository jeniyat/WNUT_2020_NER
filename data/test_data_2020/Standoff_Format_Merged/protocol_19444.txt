Immunofluorescence Assay to detect respiratory syncytial virus
Fix the cells immerge them into a pure cold acetone for 5min.
Wash 3X the sample in PBS for 3min each and at room temperature (r.t.).
Permeabilize the cells incubate with 0.1 % Triton-X100 for 15min at r.t.
Wash 3X the sample in PBS for 3min each and at r.t.
Incubate the cells with 1:100 dilution of anti-RSV blend monoclonal antibody (MAB858-4 ; Millipore, MA, USA) in PBS with 1 % Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 0.2 % Tween 20.
Keep it inside a humidified chamber for 30min at r.t.
Wash 3X the sample in PBS for 5min each and at r.t.
Incubate the sample for 15min at r.t in n a Block solution (10 % of specific serum diluted in PBS 1X).
Wash 3X the sample in PBS for 3min each and at r.t.
Incubate the cells with the secondary antibody solution for 30min at r.t. and inside a humidified chamber.
It was used Donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) diluted 1:200 in PBS with 1 % BSA.
Wash 3X the sample in PBS for 5min each and at r.t.
Incubate the cells with 5 g/ml of DAPI solution (diluted in PBS) for 5min at r.t. and inside a humidified chamber.
Wash 2X the sample in PBS for 5min each and at r.t.
Mount coverslip with a drop of mounting medium (90 % glycerol diluted in PBS).
Seal coverslip with nail polish to prevent drying and movement under microscope.
Store in dark at -20 C or +4 C.
