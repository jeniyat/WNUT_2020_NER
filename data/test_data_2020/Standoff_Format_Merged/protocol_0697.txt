Adult mouse kidney dissociation (on ice)
Transport kidney in ice-cold PBS.
Using razor blade, mince biopsy for ~2 min until fine paste on petri dish on ice.
Weigh out 18 mg of minced kidney onto petri dish.
Transfer to 1.5 mL tube with 1 mL of collagenase enzyme mix on ice.
Incubate for 20 min on ice.
Shake tube every 30 sec.
Triturate 10x every min (starting at 2 min), using p1000 set to 700 L ; with the first trituation cut off the end of the pipet tip with razor blade.
After 20 min, let tissue chunks settle on ice 1 min.
Spin tube 70 g for 30 sec at 4 C to spin down glomeruli and tubules.
Remove 60 % of supernatant (consisting of released cells) and apply to 40 M filter on 50 mL conical.
Rinse filter with 6 mL ice-cold PBS/BSA 0.04 %.
Add 1 mL PBS to tube containing remaining enzyme mix with tissue chunks.
Triturate 10X.
Apply to 100 M filter on 50 mL conical.
Rinse filter w/10 mL PBS.
This step removes residual tissue chunks while saving glomeruli and tubules in the flow-through.
Transfer flow-through to 15 mL conical.
Spin 300 g for five minutes to pellet flow-through, consisting of glomeruli and tubules.
Remove supernatant
Add 1 mL b.
lich enzyme mix to tube containing the flow-through from the 100 M filter (should be enriched in tubules and glomeruli).
Triturate 10x.
Transfer to 1.5 mL tube.
For 15 min additional time (35 min total digestion) shake in thermomixer at 1400 RPM at 4 C.
Halfway through, stop and passage 5X w/27 gauge needle to help break up tubules and glomeruli.
Triturate digest mix 10X and transfer to the same 40 M filter on 50 mL conical.
Rinse w/6 mL ice-cold PBS/BSA 0.04 %.
Transfer flow-through from previous step into a 15 mL conical.
Spin the tube with released cells 300 g for 5 min at 4 C.
Remove supernatant (leave ~100 L).
Add 900 L of RBC lysis buffer to the 15 mL conical containing the cells.
Triturate 10X using 1 mL pipet.
Let sit two min on ice.
Add 10 mL ice-cold PBS/BSA 0.04 % to dilute RBC lysis buffer.
Spin 300 g for 5 min at 4 C.
Remove supernatant and re-suspend in 100-200 L ice-cold PBS/BSA 0.04 %.
Check viability and concentration using hemocytometer with trypan blue.
Optional : to increase the % of viable cells, at this point in the procedure you can perform dead cell removal using the EasySep dead cell removal kit according to the manufacturer s instructions.
Adjust concentration to 100 cells/ L for DropSeq or 1,000 cells/ L for Chromium.
