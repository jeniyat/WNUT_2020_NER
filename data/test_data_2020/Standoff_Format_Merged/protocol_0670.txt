DNA Clean & Concentrator -5 Protocol
In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, add 2-7 volumes of DNA Binding Buffer to each volume of DNA sample (see table below).
Mix briefly by vortexing.
For efficient recovery of genomic or large DNA (> 20 kb to > 200 kb), use the Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator (Cat. Nos. D4010, D4011).
Transfer mixture to a provided Zymo-Spin Column2 in a Collection Tube.
Centrifuge for 30 seconds.
Discard the flow-through.
Add 200 l DNA Wash Buffer to the column.
(wash 1/2).
(wash 2/2).
Add 6 l DNA Elution Buffer3 or water4 directly to the column matrix and incubate at room temperature for one minute.
Transfer the column to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 30 seconds to elute the DNA.
