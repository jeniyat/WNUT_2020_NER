Culture of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 ; f.2019-nCoV)
Cell culture tubes were moved from the 37 C incubator to a Class II Biosafety cabinet, within a PC3 laboratory environment.
Growth medium from previously prepared Vero E6 tubes was discarded to waste.
Clinical samples were prepared by diluting in Opti-Mem reduced serum growth medium without foetal bovine serum (FBS) and filtering through a 0.2 M, 13 mm Acrodisc filter (Bio-Strategy Laboratory Products, Australia).
150-200 L of filtered patient material was inoculated onto separate confluent cell monolayers along with a negative control tube (150-200 L of Opti-Mem alone).
NOTE : Fresh specimens are best for succesful viral culture.
Samples were absorbed onto cells by incubating tubes for 1 hr at 37 C before cultures were re-fed with 2 mL of pre-warmed (37 C) Opti-Mem reduced serum growth medium.
NOTE : It can be informative to collect a 200 L sample at this point as a Day 0 value to test alongside other culture samples from Day 2 onwards.
Cultures were incubated for 2-7 days until signs of cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed.
In our hands, cultures that were inoculated with patient sample extracts which, at original testing produced CTs of approximately 20 cycles, developed signs of CPE within 3 days post-inoculation.
In the event low-levels of the virus were not detected by observation of CPE in the first isolation attempt, negative cell culture supernatants should be further passaged onto fresh Vero E6 monolayers up to 3 times with testing as described in Step 6.
A cell culture is suspected of hosting virus replication based on the presence of CPE including damage to the monolayer, cell-clearing and morphological changes.
Suspected cultures were further confirmed using the Corman et al. E E and Northill et al.
ORF1ab ORF1ab novel coronavirus reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rPCRs) tests.
Samples taken from a suspected culture are expected to contain levels of virus that exceed those present in the original clinical sample so we would expect to see CT values lower than those obtained from testing the original clinical sample extract by RT-rPCRs.
SLOW CULTURES : If the CT value from an extract of the first passage of a SARS-CoV-2 culture is the same or higher (suggesting a lower viral load) than the CT value from the RT-rPCR of the original clinical sample, further investigation will be required to ensure the culture has biologically amplified virus.
Consideration should be given to whether such a result is due to the detection of viral remnants from the inoculum rather than virus amplification.
