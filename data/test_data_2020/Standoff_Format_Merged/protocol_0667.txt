AutoCUT & RUN : genome-wide profiling of chromatin proteins in a 96 well format on a Biomek
Harvest fresh culture (s) at room temperature and count cells.
The AutoCUT & RUN protocol is recommended for 50,000 to 1,000,000 mammalian cells per sample.
Tissue samples can also be profiled using AutoCUT & RUN and should be processed either manually or enzymatically into a homogenous suspension of intact cells prior to binding Concanavalin A-coated beads.

Resuspend in 1.5 mL room temperature Wash Buffer by gently pipetting and transfer if necessary to a 2 mL tube.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 two more times.
Resuspend in 1 mL room temperature Wash Buffer by gently pipetting.
While gently vortexing the cells at room temperature, add the Concanavalin A coated-bead suspension.
Place on tube nutator at room temperature for 5-10 min.
Mix well by vigorous inversion to ensure the bead-bound cells are in a homogenous suspension and divide into aliquots in 0.6-mL low-bind tubes, one for each antibody to be used.
Place on the magnet stand to clear and pull off and discard the liquid.
Place each tube at a low angle on the vortex mixer set to low (~1100 rpm) and squirt 150 L of the Antibody Buffer per sample along the side while gently vortexing to allow the solution to dislodge most or all of the beads.

Pool indexed CUT & RUN libraries and perform paired-end Illumina sequencing following the manufacturer s instructions.
We align paired-end reads using Bowtie2 version 2.2.5 with options : -- local -- very-sensitive-local -- no-unal -- no-mixed -- no-discordant -- phred33 -I 10 -X 700.
For mapping spike-in fragments, we also use the -- no-overlap -- no-dovetail options to avoid cross-mapping of the experimental genome to that of the spike-in DNA.
