Mayaro virus real-time RT-PCR - 2016 method
Assay has been used on both a Rotor-Gene 6000 / Rotor-Gene Q 5-plex using 100-place rotor discs.
Total reaction volume is 20 L.
Prepare sufficient for number of reaction plus a 'dead volume ' usually 2 extra.
Adjust as necessary if using a robotic dispenser.
Dispense 15 L to each reaction well.
Add 5 L of template, extracted DNA, controls or NTC (nuclease-free water).
Total reaction volume is 20 L
PCR
The definition used for a satisfactory positive result from a real-time fluorogenic PCR should include each of the following :
A sigmoidal curve the trace travels horizontally, curves upward, continues in an exponential rise and followed by a curve towards a horizontal plateau phase
A suitable level of fluorescence intensity as measured in comparison to a positive control (y-axis)
A defined threshold (CT) value which the fluorescent curve has clearly exceeded (Fig.1 arrow) and which sits early in the log-linear phase and is < 40 cycles
A flat or non-sigmoidal curve or a curve that crosses the threshold with a CT value > 40 cycles is considered a negative result
NTCs should not produce a curve
Examples of satisfactory sigmoidal amplification curve shape when considering an assay s fluorescent signal output.
The crossing point or threshold cycle (CT) is indicated (yellow arrow) ; it is the value at which fluorescence levels surpass a predefined (usually set during validation, or arbitrary) threshold level as shown in this normalized linear scale depiction.
LP-log-linear phase of signal generated during the exponential part of the PCR amplification ; TP-a slowing of the amplification and accompanying fluorescence signal marks the transition phase ; PP-the plateau phase is reached when there is little or no increase in fluorescent signal despite continued cycling.
