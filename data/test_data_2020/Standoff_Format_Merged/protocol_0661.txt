Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
M ller-Hinton Agar and BrothPlate the agar on plates.
Streak the bacteria onto agar plates without inhibitor.
Incubate plates for 18-24h at 37 C.
For each isolate, select three to five morphologically similar colonies from the agar plates and transfer them to a glass tube with 5ml MH-Broth.
Incubate for 18-24h at 37 C.
Measure OD450 on cultures from step 4, and make dilutions in x mL MHB to OD450 = 0,01.
Use the setup shown in the following figure.
Pipette 50 l of MHB into column 2-11.
Add 100 l MBH into column 12.
Add 100 l of the antibiotic into column 1.
Withdraw 50 l from each well in column 1, add this to the corresponding wells in column 2.
Mix by pipetting up and down 4-6 times
(this makes column 2 a twofold dilution of column 1).
Repeat step 10 down to column 10 - discard the withdrawn solution from column 10.
Vortex the bacteria suspension from step 5.
Add 50 l of the suspension to each well in columns 1-11.
Cover the plates with film, make sure to create a tight seal to prevent any evaporation.
To exclude any errors repeat every plate setup three times (triplicates).
Incubate the plate at 37 C for 16-24h.
Measure the growth by determinating OD450
Compare the data from the three triplicates, and exclude any deviations.
