Assembling Viral Metagenomic Data with SPAdes (Cyverse)
Open SPAdes Open SPAdes from `` Apps. ``.
Select Inputs Select the 'Inputs ' tab
For Library1, Paired Reads, reads1Navigate to Community Data -- > iVirus -- > ExampleData -- > SPAdes -- > Input.
Select OSD46_R1_shotgun_workable_PE.fastq Alternatively, copy-and-paste the location : /iplant/home/shared/iVirus/ExampleData/SPAdes/Inputs into the navigation bar and select the fastq file.
For Library2, Paired Reads, reads2Navigate to Community Data -- > iVirus -- > ExampleData -- > SPAdes -- > Input.
Select OSD46_R2_shotgun_workable_PE.fastq Alternatively, copy-and-paste the location : /iplant/home/shared/iVirus/ExampleData/SPAdes/Inputs into the navigation bar and select the fastq file.
For Library2, Paired Reads, reads2.
Select Parameters The default parameters will be sufficient for this example.
Of note is the change in 'Kmer setting (s) ' where we have changed the default (35) to a mixture of 21,33,55.
We have found this produces good viral assemblies, though your mileage may vary
Also to note are the fact that the 'Input ' files are directly dependent on the 'Parameters. ' In this example we selected 2 paired end files.
Each of these are 'paired reads ' because they have partners, and the 'pairing format, library 1 ' is 'paired end. ' With other data, users can mix-and-match paired and unpaired reads for up to 5 libraries.
Launch Analysis Run the job! Depending on the dataset, this could take hours or days.
This sample dataset should only take a few hours.
Results Expect results can be found in the SPAdes ' 'Output ' directory
An abbreviated output of important files generated during assembly.
The most important files are contigs.fasta and scaffolds.fasta.
They contained the assembled sequences (i.e. contigs).
You should save this file.
