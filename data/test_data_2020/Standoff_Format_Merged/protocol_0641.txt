Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qPCR
Seed cells at a density of 1 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate.
Culture cells under 5 % CO2, in a 95 % humidified atmosphere at 37.
48 h post-transfection, the total cellular RNA is extracted using a Total RNA Extraction Kit (Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer s protocol stated as below.
Wash cells three times with the PBS.
Strip cells with cell scraper, collect cells in a nuclease-free EP tube by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, and then discard the supernatant.
Add 100 l of RNA lysate to the cell pellet, resuspend the cells with a pipette, transfer the lysate into a 1.5 ml nuclease-free EP tube, then add 100 l of the dilution, and mix the mixture by inverting four times.
Incubate the lysate at 70 for 3 minutes to increase the RNA yield.
Centrifuge at 14,000 g for 5 minutes.
Carefully aspirate the supernatant into a 1.5 ml nuclease-free EP tube.
Add 0.5 times the supernatant volume of anhydrous ethanol, mix 4 times with a pipette.
Remove the centrifuge column/collection tube, and transfer the mixture to the centrifuge column.
If the volume of the mixture is greater than 750 l, add the mixture in batches.
Centrifuge at 14,000 g for 1 minutes, discard the filtrate, and put the centrifuge column back into the collection tube.
Add 600 l wash buffer to the column, centrifuge at 14,000 g for 45 seconds, and discard the filtrate.
Take a nuclease-free tube, add 5 l of 10 DNase I buffer, 5 l of DNase I, and 40 l of nuclease-free water, and then gently mix them.
The amount for extraction of a tube of RNA required by DNase I incubation is 50 l.
Add 50 l of freshly prepared DNase I incubation solution to the centrifuge tube and incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
Add 600 l RNA wash buffer to the column, centrifuge at 14,000 g for 45 seconds, and discard the filtrate.
Repeat step 13 once
And then centrifuge at 14,000 g for 2 minutes.
Transfer the centrifuge column into the elution tube, add 50 l of nuclease-free water to the spin-off membrane, incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes, and centrifuge at 14,000 g for 1 minute.
Add the elution solution to the center of the column, incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes, and centrifuge at 14,000 g for 1 minute to elute RNA again.
Determine the concentration of RNA by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.
