Isolation of plasmid DNA from E. coli (Alkaline lysis method)
Buffer P1 : 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 ; 10 mM EDTA ; 100 mg/mL RNase A, (store at 4 C)
Buffer P2 : 0.2 M NaOH ; 1 % (w/v) SDS
Buffer P3 : 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 ; 10 mM EDTA ; 100 mg/mL RNase A (store at 4 C)
Buffer P2 : 0.2 M NaOH ; 1 % (w/v) SDS
Buffer P3 : 0.2 M NaOH ; 1 % (w/v) SDS 3 M Potassium acetate, pH 5.5.
Inoculate 5 mL LB, supplemented with appropriate antibiotics, using a single colony.
Grow over night at 37 C.
Centrifuge culture at maximum speed and RT for 1 min.
Completely remove supernatant.
Resuspend in 350 L buffer P1.
Add 350 L buffer P2.
Gently mix by inverting (do not vortex!).
Incubate for up to 5 min at RT.
(Note : If incubated for too long, sheared genomic DNA fragments may contaminate the sample.).
Add 400 L buffer P3.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at RT and maximum speed.
Carefully transfer supernatant to a fresh tube, with as little contamination of pelletted material as possible.
If necessary, centrifuge the supernatant again (Step 7) to completely remove pellet.
Add 1 volume of isopropanol.
Incubate on ice for at least 2 minutes.
(Note : Incubation time can be increased to an hour, if required.).
Centrifuge sample for 5 minutes at RT and maximum speed.
Carefully remove supernatant without discarding the DNA pellet
Wash pellet by adding 500 L of 70 % ethanol (do not resuspend).
Dry pellet in a thermoblock at 65 C for 10 minutes.
Resuspend pellet in 50-100 L pure water or buffer of choice (e.g. TE buffer)
Optional : Sample can be incubated at 65 C to dissolve DNA more efficiently.
