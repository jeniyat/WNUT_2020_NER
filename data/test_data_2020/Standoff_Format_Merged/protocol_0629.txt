Pouring LB Agar Plates
Measure of pre-mixed LB-agar powder per L of molten agar you d like to make.
The precise mass you measure out will be based on the number of plates you d like to pour.
Transfer the LB-agar powder you ve measured out into an appropriately sized bottle for autoclaving.
We make of agar in bottles and of agar in bottles.
The extra empty volume is necessary to prevent your molten agar from boiling over in the autoclave.
Transfer the sterile water (in our case) to the same bottle and swirl to form a medium/agar colloid.
Cover the opening of the bottle with its cap or aluminum foil (but do not make an air-tight seal!) and tape the bottle with autoclave tape.
The autoclave tape will darken during the autoclave process if your sample has spent at least min at.
Use lab tape to label the bottle with your initials, the date, and the bottle contents.
This will clear up any confusion later if your forget your bottle in the autoclave.
Place the gel mix in the autoclave and run on a setting that gets the sample to at least under 20 psi for at least.
The high pressure will prevent your gel mix from boiling over at high temperature.
While your samples are sterilizing in the autoclave, you should prepare your plate pouring station : Find an empty section of lab bench with a working flame
Spray down the bench with a 70 % ethanol solution and wipe down with a paper towel
Count out the appropriate number of plates and stack them on your lab bench
Label the plates with the date and the medium they will contain including the identity of the antibiotic.
Position the flame just to the side of where you ll be pouring your plates - be sure to leave room for your bottle of molten gel mix, a tube rack containing the appropriate antibiotics, and a section for active pouring

Prepare your antibiotics
Prior to adding your antibiotic to the molten gel mix, you should create a 1000x stock solution.
Prepare a water bath at 60 with sufficient water to submerge ~75 % of the bottle containing your molten gel mixture.
Retrieve your molten agar mix from the autoclave.
Partially submerge your molten gel-mix in the water bath.
Light the flame at the plate pouring station and dilute your antibiotic into your ~ molten gel mix using sterile technique.
Swirl the agar bottle to ensure even distribution of the antibiotic throughout the agar.
Open one plate at a time next to the flame and begin pouring.
Measure your desired amount of agar with a pipete for the first plate to get a good idea of what that volume looks like in your particular plate.
For the remainder of the plates, pour directly from the bottle.
Leave your plates out on the bench to solidify.
Once your plates have solidified and dried, you should test them to make sure the antibiotic functions properly : Take out two plates
On the first plate, streak out a strain that you know to be resistant to the antibiotic
On the second plate, streak out a strain that s not resistant to the antibiotic
Incubate both plates overnight at the appropriate growth temperature and check for growth.
See our sample data section below for positive and negative test results
