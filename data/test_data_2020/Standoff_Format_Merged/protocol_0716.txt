Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit
Add 600 l of bacterial culture grown in LB medium to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Add 100 l of 7X Lysis Buffer (Blue) 1 and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Proceed to step 3 within 2 minutes.
Add 350 l of cold Neutralization Buffer (Yellow) and mix thoroughly.
The sample will turn yellow when the neutralization is complete and a yellowish precipitate will form.
Invert the sample an additional 2-3 times to ensure complete neutralization.
Centrifuge at 11,000 16,000 x g for 2-4 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant (~900 l) into the provided Zymo-Spin IIN column.
Avoid disturbing the cell debris pellet.
Place the column into a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 15 seconds.
Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same Collection Tube.
Add 200 l of Endo-Wash Buffer to the column.
Centrifuge for 30 seconds.
Add 400 l of Zyppy Wash Buffer to the column.
Centrifuge for 1 minute.
Transfer the column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube then add 30 l of Zyppy Elution Buffer2 directly to the column matrix and let stand for one minute at room temperature.
Centrifuge for 30 seconds to elute the plasmid DNA.
