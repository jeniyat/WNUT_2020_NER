SARS-CoV2 virus plaque assays (Biosafety level 3)
Media recipe for modified DMEM : [ DMEM with 2 % FBS ] :
475 ml DMEM (w/ L-Glutamate, Sodium pyruvate)
5 ml 100x P/S
5 ml 100x Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA) Solution
5 ml 1M HEPES
10 ml FBS
Media recipe for 2XMEM : Sterile filter with 22 m filtration unit :
100 ml 10x MEM
10 ml 100x P/S
10 ml 100x L-Glutamine
6 ml 35 % BSA
340 ml sterile ddH2O
10 ml 1M HEPES
24 ml 5 % NaHCO3
Overlay Media (Ensure this is just warm to the touch when added to cells)
1 ml PBS
31.5 ml 2X MEM
17.5 ml Oxoid Agar
Seed Vero E6 cells in 6-well plates overnight at 37 C (106 cells/well)
Dilute the SARS-CoV-2 virus logarithmically in infection media
Replace media with modified DMEM and add diluted virus in each well (200 l/well)
Allow virus adsorption for 01:00:00, agitating the plate every 00:10:00.
Heat the overlay media/oxoid agar mixture to ensure homogenous consistency and add it to each well (2ml/well), incubate at 37 C incubator for 72:00:00.
Fix the plate with 5 % formaldehyde (w/ methanol), (1.5 ml/per well) Overnight to ensure virus inactivation and Stain with crystal violet for 01:00:00 to determine viral titers (PFU/ml)
