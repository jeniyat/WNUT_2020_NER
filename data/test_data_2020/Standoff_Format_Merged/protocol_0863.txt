Near-Infrared (NIR) Western Blot Detection (nitrocellulose membrane)
After membrane transfer and you have removed the membrane from the transfer stack, allow the membrane to air dry.
This takes about 1 hour at room temperature, depending on lab conditions.
After you have air dried, the membrane, wet it in 1X PBS or TBS for 2 minutes, or until fully hydrated (using the appropriate buffer system).
Place membrane in incubation box and block the membrane in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (PBS or TBS) for 1 hour with gentle shaking.
Be sure to use sufficient blocking buffer to cover the membrane (a minimum of 0.4 mL/cm2 is suggested).
Primary antibody diluent : Odyssey Blocking Buffer (PBS or TBS) + 0.2 % Tween 20 (final concentration).
Dilute primary antibody in Odyssey Blocking Buffer + 0.2 % Tween 20, using the vendor s recommended dilution for Western blot applications.
Dilutions typically range from 1:200 - 1:5,000, depending on the primary antibody.
Use enough antibody solution to completely cover the membrane.
Incubate blot in diluted primary antibody for 1 to 4 hours* at room temperature with gentle shaking, or overnight at 4 C.
If the procedure can not be completed in full, this is a good place to stop until the following day.
Incubate the blot in primary antibody overnight at 4 C with gentle shaking, and resume the protocol the next day.
Pour off primary antibody solution.
(wash 1/4).
Rinse membrane with appropriate buffer 1X TBS-T (0.1 % Tween 20) or 1X PBS-T (0.1 % Tween 20).
Cover blot with 1X TBS-T (0.1 % Tween 20) or 1X PBS-T (0.1 % Tween 20).
Shake vigorously on platform shaker at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Pour off wash solution.
(wash 2/4)
(wash 3/4).
(wash 4/4).
Secondary antibody diluent : To blocking buffer, add Tween 20 to a final concentration of 0.2 %.
Do not add SDS.
Protect membrane from light during incubation.
Incubate blot in diluted secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature with gentle shaking.
Protect membrane from light during washes.
Pour off secondary antibody solution.
(wash 2/).
Rinse membrane with 1X TBS or 1X PBS (as appropriate) to remove residual Tween 20.
The Western blot is now ready to image.
The membrane can be stored in 1X TBS or 1X PBS for up to 48 hours in the dark at 4 C.
If the blot is prepared more than 48 hours in advance, air-dry the blot and store in the dark at room temperature until ready to image.
Dried blots kept in the dark can be imaged up to 3 years later without loss of signal.
If signal on membrane is too strong or too weak, adjust the imaging parameters to optimize the image.
Odyssey Classic : Re-image the membrane at a lower or higher scan intensity setting, respectively.
Odyssey Fc : Adjust image acquisition time.
Odyssey CLx : Use the AutoScan function to improve the dynamic range of the image.
