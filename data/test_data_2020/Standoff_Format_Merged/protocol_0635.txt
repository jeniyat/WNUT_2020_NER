Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) high throughput (HTP) DNA extraction protocol
Wear gloves at all times while handling materials related to this protocol.
The first step of the genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation/extraction is to add sample material to the desired wells of the 96-well PowerBead DNA Plate (s), Garnet.
Remove nuclease and nucleotide contamination from work surfaces and instruments prior to starting using an appropriate solution, such as RNase AWAY (Thermo Scientific catalogue : 700511), followed by wiping with 70 % to 100 % molecular biology grade ethanol to remove additional contaminants.
Remove the PowerBead DNA Plate (Bead Plate) from the QIAGEN MagAttract PowerSoil DNA KF Kit (384), and centrifuge for 1 minute at 2500 x g to pellet the garnet beads prior to sample addition.
Remove the Square Well Mat from the Bead Plate and set aside in a sterile location.
Add samples to Bead Plate :.
This is an appropriate stopping point, or continue directly to the next step
Ensure that you continue to retain the Square Well Mat in a sterile fashion.
Clean all work surfaces and instruments with RNase AWAY reagent (Thermo Scientific catalogue : 700511), wipe dry, and repeat with 70 % -100 % ethanol, wipe dry.
Turn on a water bath to 65 C.
In a sterile reservoir, add 400 l RNase A Solution to 75 ml of PowerBead Solution (Bead Solution) for every 96-well plate that will be processed.
Add 750 l of Bead Solution/RNase A Solution to each well of the Bead Plate (s).
Check the bottle (s) of SL Solution, Lysis buffer.
If precipitate is visible, heat at 60 C until dissolved.
Add 60 l of SL Solution to each well.
Secure the Square Well Mat (retained during sample addition to Bead Plate) tightly to the plate.
Place sealed Bead Plate (s) in 65 C water bath for 10 minutes.
DO NOT SUBMERGE THE PLATE (S).
Remove excess water from the Bead Plate (s) and make sure that all wells are still fully sealed
Place the Bead Plate (s) between two Adapter Plates (QIAGEN catalogue : 11990) and securely fasten to a 96-well Plate Shaker (such as, QIAGEN TissueLyser II ; QIAGEN catalogue : 85300).
Shake at speed 20 Hz for 20 minutes.
Centrifuge Bead Plate (s) at room temperature for 6 minutes at 3220 x g (or 4500 x g depending on centrifuge)
While centrifuging, or during Bead Plate shaking, add 450 l IR Solution (Inhibitor Removal Technology Solution) to each well of a clean/empty Collection Plate (1 ml) (provided in kit), and cover with clear Sealing Tape (provided in kit).
Sufficiently clean the work surface and a multichannel pipette that is capable of transfering volumes up to 1000 l.
Remove the lysate-containing Bead Plate (s) from the centrifuge, and carefully remove and discard the Square Well Mat.
Remove the Sealing Tape from the IR Solution-containing Collection Plate
Transfer 640 l, or less, lysate from each well of the Bead Plate to the Collection Plate, and mix gently by pipetting up and down 4 times.
Apply a new Sealing Tape to the lysate/IR-containing Collection Plate (repeat process if working with a second Bead Plate)
Incubate Collection Plate (s) at 4 C for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge lysate/IR Collection Plate (s) at 3220 x g for 6 minutes.
Remove Sealing Tape from lysate/IR Collection Plate (s).
Transfer entire volume of supernatant (~ 850 l), avoiding pellet, to a new/sterile 1 ml Collection Plate (Collection Plate # 2).
Discard the used Collection Plate (s).
Apply new Sealing Tape to Collection Plate (s) # 2, and centrifuge at 3220 x g for 6 minutes.
Remove the Sealing Tape from Collection Plate (s) # 2, and transfer 450 l of supernatant to a clean KingFisher Deep Well 96 Plate.
Transfer the remaining supernatant, 400 l, to a second KingFisher Deep Well 96 Plate.
Discard Collection Plate (s) # 2.
For each 96 well plate processed, aliquot 500 l ClearMag Wash Solution to each well of 3 clean KingFisher Deep Well 96 Plates, and 100 l Solution EB, Elution buffer, to each well of 1 clean KingFisher 96 KF Microtiter (200 l) Plate.
For each 96 well plate processed, suspend 2 ml ClearMag Zorb Reagent in 45 ml of ClearMag Binding Solution in a clean reservoir
Pipette up and down thoroughly to evenly disperse the magnetic beads in solution.
For each 96 well plate processed, add 47 ml of ClearMag Binding Solution to a separate, clean, reservoir.
Add 470 l ClearMag Zorb Reagent/ClearMag Binding Solution to each well of one sample lysate containing KingFisher Deep Well 96 Plate.
To the remaining KingFisher Deep Well 96 Plate (s) containing lysate, add 470 l ClearMag Binding Solution to each well.
Initiate the 'KF_Flex_MoBio_PowerMag_Soil_DNA ' program on the KingFisher Flex robot.
Ensure that the protocol is set to utilize both sample lysate aliquots.

Follow the onscreen prompts to properly load the KingFisher Flex.
The loading order should be : the tip comb, elution plate, ClearMag Wash Solution filled plates, lysate with ClearMag Binding Solution plate (Bind 2), and lysate containing ClearMag Binding Solution/ClearMag Zorb Reagent plate (Bind1).
The selected KingFisher Flex program will execute itself once the final plate is added and `` Start '' is pressed.
The program takes approximately 65 minutes to complete, and requires no user intervention.
When the KingFisher Flex program finishes, remove the gDNA containing elution plate, and seal this with an appropriate storage seal (not Sealing Tape from kit).
Follow the onscreen prompts to cycle through each station on the KingFisher Flex deck
Dispose of all liquids from plates as hazardous chemical waste (the gDNA elution plate should already be removed and appropriately sealed), and discard the emptied plates.
The gDNA is now ready for downstream applications.
