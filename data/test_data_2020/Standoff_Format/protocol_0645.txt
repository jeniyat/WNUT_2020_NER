Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (28704 and 28706), centrifuge processing
Excise DNA fragment from agarose gel with clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube.
Maximum amount of gel per column is 400mg (about 0.4cm3).
Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100mg gel ~ 100μL).
For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 minutes (or until gel slice has completely dissolved).
[Optional]: Vortex every 2-3 min to help dissolve gel.
Check color of mixture to ensure it is yellow, similar to Buffer QG without dissolve agarose.
If color is orange or violet, add 10μL of 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix.
For purifying <500bp or >4kb, add 1 volume isopropanol to increase yield and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min then discard flow through.
The maximum volume is 800μL.
For larger volumes, load and spin again.
Return QIAquick column to collection tube.
If the DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing, in vitro transcription, or microinjection, add 500μL Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for one minute.
Discard flow through and return column to collection tube.
To wash, add 750 μl Buffer PE to the QIAquick column.
If DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications (e.g. sequencing, blunt-ended ligation), let column stand for 2-5 minutes
Centrifuge for 1 minute.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min
IMPORTANT: Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA.
The average eluate volume is 48 µl from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl elution buffer
Elution efficiency is dependent on pH.
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5.
When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent.
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA.
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes (bromophenol blue, xylene cyanol, and orange G) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time.
Refer to Table 2 (page 15) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type.
