Restriction Digest of DNA
Select restriction enzymes to digest your plasmid.
Determine an appropriate reaction buffer by reading the instructions for your enzyme.
In a 1.5mL tube combine the following : DNA (all amounts are for a typical reaction ; your amount may vary depending on the enzymes).
Typical mixture for single digest : Nuclease-free Water, 16 ul ; 10X Buffer EcoRI2 ulDNA (0.5/1 ug/ul), 1 ul ; EcoRI0. 5-2 ul ;
Typical Mixture for Double Digest : Nuclease-free Water, 15 ul ; 10X Buffer, 02 ul ; DNA (0.5-1 ug/ul), 1 ul ; EcoRI, 1 ul ; PstI, 1 ul ;
Mix gently by pipetting.
Incubate tube at appropriate temperature (usually 37 C) for 1 hour.
