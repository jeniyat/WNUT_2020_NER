Quick Fungal DNA Extraction
Inoculate fungal material into 300 L rich growth medium in a 2 mL micro-centrifuge tube.Grow at RT for 3-4 days.
Freeze culture tubes in LN2Freeze dry over night.
Add 50 L 0.6mm glass beads to freeze-dried sample in 2 mL tube and grind using Tissue-Lyser LT for 5 mins at 50 Hz.
Add 500 L lysis buffer to pulverised sample.
Vortex to mix Heat to 45 C for 5 mins, shaking at 1200 rpm.
Add 0.5 vol (250 L) 3 M Potassium Acetate to lysis mix.
Vortex to mix.
Centrifuge at 12 K rpm for a minimum of 15 minutes @ 4 C.
Transfer supernatant (~ 650 L) to fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 1 vol chilled Isopropanol (~ 700 L) to the supernatant, mix well, incubate -20 C for 1hr.
Centrifuge at 12 K rpm for a minimum of 15 minutes at 4 C.
Decant gently or aspirate supernatant.
To the pellet add 500 L 70 % ethanol stored at -20 C.
Centrifuge at 12 K rpm for a minimum of 3 minutes at 4 C.
Discard supernatant.
Repeat wash step with 500 L of cold 70 % ethanol.
Spin and discard supernatant.
Dry pellet in speed-vac at 45 C for 5-10 minutes.
Re-suspend pellet in nuclease free water or TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0).
Add 50 L 3M Sodium Acetate pH 5.5
