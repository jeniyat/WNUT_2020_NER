XIT Genomic DNA Blood Kit Protocol for Isolation of Genomic DNA (for 5ml blood)
Invert the tube to mix and incubate 2 3 minutes at room temperature.
Centrifuge 2,000xg for 5 minutes then remove supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet.
Add 10ml of RBC Lysis Buffer to the pellet and mix.
Centrifuge 2,000xg for 5 minutes then remove supernatant.
Repeat steps 4 and 5 if pellet is not white.
Vortex the tube to resuspend the cells in the residual liquid.
Add 4ml of XIT Lysis Buffer to the resuspended cells and vortex vigorously to lyse the cells.
Usually no incubation is required ; however, if cell clumps are visible after mixing, incubate at 37 C for 5 10 minutes or until the solution is homogenous.
Add 900 l XIT Protein Precipitation Buffer to the sample and mix by inverting the tube 10 20 times.
Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes.
Carefully, transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
Add 4ml isopropanol to the supernatant and mix by gently inverting the sample at least 20 25 times.
Centrifuge at 2,000g for 5 minutes.
Discard the supernatant and use a pipette to carefully remove remaining liquid without disturbing the DNA pellet.
Add 2ml 70 % ethanol and invert the tube twice to wash the pellet.
Centrifuge at 2,000g for 3 minutes.
Discard the supernatant and drain the tube on a piece of clean absorbent paper.
Allow to air dry for 15 minutes.
Add 500 l TE buffer to dissolve the DNA.
Rehydrate the genomic DNA by incubating at 55 65 C for one hour.
Incubate overnight at room temperature to ensure complete genomic DNA hydration.
Store DNA at 4 C, for long term storage store at 20 or 80 C.
Add 5ml whole blood to a 15ml centrifuge tube containing 5ml RBC Lysis Buffer.
