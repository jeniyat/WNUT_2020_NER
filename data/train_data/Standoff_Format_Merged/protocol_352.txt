One-step growth experiments (cyanophages)
Set up triplicate adsorption tubes (AT) in 1.5 mL microtubes.
Add phages of a known titer to the cyanobacteria host in exponential growth (cell concentration determined by microscopy ; Cyanoinput) at an MOI of approximately 0.02.
Allow the phages to adsorb to the hosts for 60 mins at room temperature and an illumination of 25 mol quanta m 2s 1.
Set up control tubes (CT) as above, except :
a. positive controls : replace host cells with media (this gives input phage numbers).
b. negative controls : omit virus After 60 min, remove unadsorbed phages (T = 0).
Prepare nine 15-mL centrifuge tubes containing 10 mL algal growth media.
Add 100 L from AT to FGT (10 2 dilution).
Mix and remove 0.1 mL sample for T = 0.
Perform plaque assay immediately to determine total infective centers (TICT=0).
Add 100 L from FGT to SGT (10 4 dilution).
Incubate FGT and SGT tubes at room temperature and ca.
25 mol quanta m 2s 1 Remove 100 L samples every 3 h from FGT (at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 h) and SGT (from 12 h onwards) for ca. 30 h.
Determine the TIC via plaque assay.
Add 100 L from positive control tube (CT) to FGT-control (10 2 dilution).
Determine the total phage input (Phageinput).
