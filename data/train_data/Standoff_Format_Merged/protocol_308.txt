RNA sequencing library construction for Illumina GA II
Fragment 400ng of amplified mRNA to 10 200nt using 10x RNA fragmentation buffer (Ambion).
Purify using regular ethanol precipitation method with 0.35 l of GlycoBlue (Ambion).
Dephosphorylate the 3 end the RNA samples using 10x Antarctic Phosphatase Buffer and 0.5 l Antarctic Phosphatase (NEB) at 37 C for 20 minutes.
Heat inactivate at 75 C for 10 minutes.
Phosphorylate the 5 end of RNA samples was using 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer (it has 1mM ATP final) and T4 PNK (NEB) at 37 C for 30 minutes.
Purify the RNAs in the reactions using ammonium acetate and ethanol precipitation with 2 l of GlycoBlue (Ambion).
Ligate the RNA samples at 37 C for one hour to 3 linker (5 /5rApp/CTG TAG GCA CCA TCA AT/3ddC/ 3) (synthesized by IDT) using : T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB), 5X ATP free T4 RNA ligase buffer (16.5 mM DTT, 41.5 % glycerol, 250 mM HEPES KOH, pH8.3, 50 mM MgCl2, 50 g/ml acetylated BSA), and 10 % DMSO.
Purify the RNAs in the reactions using ammonium acetate and ethanol precipitation with 2 l of GlycoBlue (Ambion).
