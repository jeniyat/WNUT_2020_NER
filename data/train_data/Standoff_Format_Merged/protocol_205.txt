SWIFT Western Transfer Pads
Soak the PVDF membrane in 100 % methanol for 1 2 minutes then rinse 2 3 times with deionized water.
Equilibrate PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane in diluted SWIFT Western Buffer for 5 10 minutes.
Place the supplied SWIFT Template Card on a flat surface and place a SWIFT Western Transfer Pad on the Template Card.
Add diluted SWIFT Western Buffer on top of the pad to soak it further.
Use 2ml each for the 8.5 x 7.5cm and 5ml each for the 15 x 9.5cm size pads.
Carefully place the gel on top of the SWIFT Western Transfer Pad and ensure no air bubbles are formed.
Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.
The incubation step improves protein transfer efficiency.
Place the blotting membrane equilibrated in diluted SWIFT Western Buffer on top of the gel, avoiding air bubbles.
Place another piece of SWIFT Western Transfer Pad on top of the membrane, avoiding air bubbles.
Remove any air bubbles by rolling a tube or pipette over the top of the sandwich.
Slide the blot sandwich onto a transfer cassette, including fiber pads soaked in diluted SWIFT Western Buffer.
Put the assembled transfer cassette in a Western transfer module with diluted SWIFT Western Buffer and run it for 30 60 minutes at 200mA fixed current.
