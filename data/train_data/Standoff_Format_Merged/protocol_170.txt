Hemolysis Assay
Wash and concentrate blood, prepare 2 % blood solution.
Add 3 mL rabbit blood to 14 mL PBS pH 5.7 and mix.
Centrifuge 10 min 500g 4C.
Remove supernatant.
Repeat steps for a total of 4 washes.
After the final wash, remove 200 uL blood from the bottom of the vial and add to 9.8 mL PBS pH 5.7.
Prepare endosomal disruptor solutions.
Prepare 100 uL solutions of endosomal disruptors at different concentrations (Ex serial 10x dilutions of TritonX from 15 mg/mL to .0015 mg/mL).
Add blood to endosomal disruptors and incubate.
Add 50 uL blood solution to 100 uL endosomal disruptor solutions.
Incubate at 37C for 30 min, starting timer as soon as last solution added.
Make positive control.
Make a positive control (known lysis) by adding 50 uL blood solution to 100 uL diH2O and freeze-thaw cycling 3 times (freeze in -80C freezer).
Centrifuge and place in plate.
Centrifuge in tabletop centrifuge at 2500g for 6 min.
Carefully collect 75 uL of supernatant from each tube and place in 96 well plate.
**Solutions bubble easily so be very carefully not to introduce any air**.
Disrupting bottom pellet creates false positives.
Take absorbance.
Take absorbance at 541 nm.
Can also do absorbance scan if worried about side reactions
