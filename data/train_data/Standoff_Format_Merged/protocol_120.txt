OmniPrep for Fungus
To avoid repeated freezing thaw, dispense the Proteinase K solution into aliquots of 30 l/tube and freeze at 20 C.
If a precipitate forms due to cold storage allow to warm to room temperature until precipitate dissolves.
Centrifuge the Molecular Grinding Resin tube for 2 minutes at 2,500x g and remove the water.
Add 0.5ml Genomic Lysis Buffer.
Collect fungal tissue from liquid culture and wash 2 3 times in sterile water.
Fungal mycelia are best prepared by grinding samples using Molecular GrindingResin in Genomic Lysis Buffer.
Add 10 20mg fungal mycelia to a microcentrifuge tube containing 500 l Genomic Lysis Buffer.
Resuspend Molecular Grinding Resin by vigorous mixing or vortexing.
Add 30 l Molecular Grinding Resin using a wide bore pipette tips and grind with a microcentrifuge pestle.
Add 1 l Proteinase K solution for every 100 l Lysis Buffer and incubate at 60 C for 1 2 hours.
Invert the tube periodically each hour.
Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
Add 200 l chloroform and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000xg and carefully remove the upper phase to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 l DNA Stripping Solution to the sample and invert several times to mix.
Incubate the sample for 5 10 minutes at 60 C.
Add 100 l Precipitation Solution and mix by inverting the tube several times.
A white precipitate should be produced, if not add 50 l aliquots of Precipitation Solution until a white precipitate forms.
Centrifuge the sample at 14,000xg for 5 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and precipitate the genomic DNA with 500 l isopropanol.
Invert the tubes 10 times to precipitate the DNA.
Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 5 minutes to pellet genomic DNA.
Remove the supernatant.
Add 700 l 70 % ethanol to the tube and invert several times to wash the DNA pellet.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000xg.
Decant or pipette off the ethanol wash.
Invert the tube on a clean absorbent surface for several minutes to allow any excess ethanol to drain away.
Do not let the pellet dry completely or it will be difficult to rehydrate.
Add 50 to 100 l TE Buffer to the pellet.
Incubate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to rehydrate.
Incubating the tube at 55 60 C will speed up rehydration.
Incubate for 5 60 minutes.
OPTIONAL : Add 1 l LongLife RNase for every 100 l TE Buffer at this stage.
Store DNA at 4 C, for long term storage store at 20 C or 80 C.
