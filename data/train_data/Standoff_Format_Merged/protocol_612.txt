Filtering for Cell Collection Pump Steel filter tank A/E filter Durapore DI rinsed cubie container (the one the sample was in).
Clamp all tubes to manifolds and filter tanks.
Make sure bleeder valves are on top.
Turn on pump and then bleed A/E then Durapore and the A/E again.
Keep cubie container on ice- water will be used for viral concentration.
Place out tube from Durapore onto a filter flask that is attached to the vacuum side of the pump.
Wait until water stops moving towards the vacuum and only bubbles are coming through.
Open steel filter tank lid and slowly open tank bleeder valve to depressurize (SLOWLY).
When pressure has dropped significantly push in steel tank lid, allow a few more minutes for water to drain through.
Disconnect clamp from bottom side of A/E filter, remove tube from out side of A/E.
Place Durapore on knees and swirl gently so all water goes into the filter flask.
Once water is out, open manifold slowly, fold up filter and place in whirlpack.
Remove Durapore out tube from filter flask, place A/E out tube onto filter flask.
Place A/E on knees, let water drain out into the filter flask as before.
Open manifold slowly, peel off ring of filter, discard, fold filter and place in whirlpack.
Okay to turn off pump now.
