DNA Extraction for college laboratory setting
Label one tube for each plant.
Harvest 2-3 seedlings and place in a mortar.
Fill with about 50 ml of liquid nitrogen.
Grind tissue with pestle.
Add 1 ml of extraction buffer to the tube.
Add 120 l of 10 % SDS.
Mix by inverting.
Incubate tube (s) at 65 C for 20 minutes.
Add 300 l 5M KOAc.
Mix well by inverting several times (important!), then place on ice 5 minutes.
Centrifuge for 5 minutes at > 12,000 rpm.
Label a second tube.
Pass 700 l of the supernatant through a miracloth funnel into the second tube.
Add 600 l of isopropanol.
Mix the contents thoroughly by inverting.
Spin for 5 minutes at 14,000 rpm.
Carefully pour off and discard the supernatant.
Use a P20 set to 20 l to remove the remaining drops of liquid without disturbing the DNA pellet.
Add 500 l of 70 % ethanol and flick the tube until the pellet comes off the bottom.
Spin 5 minutes.
Pour off the ethanol.
Use a P20 set to 20 l to remove the remaining drops without disturbing the pellet.
Leave the tube open on the bench to air dry for 5-10 minutes.
Resuspend the DNA in 50 l TE and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes for complete resuspension.
Samples should be frozen for storage.
