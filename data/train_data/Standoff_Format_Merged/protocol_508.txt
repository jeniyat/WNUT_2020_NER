Sampling for Flow Cytometry (FCM)
Advance preparation : for each sample to be collected, aliquot 900 l of seawater (artificial seawater salts or complete sterile medium) into a labeled 1.2 ml cryovial.
Collect sample : add 100 l of sample into cryovial containing 900 l of seawater.
Keep cryovial cap clean and sterile.
Preserve/fix sample : In the chemical fume hood, lay out cryovial caps (inside cap facing up) and use the repeator pipet to add 5 l of glutaraldehyde (25 %) to each cap.
Cap each tube and mix well by inverting a few times.
Incubate for 10 minutes in the dark.
Flash-freeze tubes in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 C until analysis.
