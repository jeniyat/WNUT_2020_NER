Gel DNA Recovery
Excise up to 200 mg gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a clean scalpel or razor blade.
Cut as close to the DNA as possible to minimize the gel volume.
Place the gel slice into a 1.5 mL tube.
Add 200 L of Extraction Buffer.
Mix thoroughly by pippeting.
Incubate the gel mixture at 50-58 C for 10 minutes or until the gel slice is completely dissolved.
Mix the tube by inversion every few minutes to facilitate the melting process.
Ensure that the gel is completely dissolved.
Add 200 L of ethanol (96-100 %) and mix by pipetting.
Transfer the mixture to the DNA Purification Micro Column preassembled with a collection tube.
Centrifuge the column for 1 minute at 14,000 g.
Discard the flow-through.
Place the DNA Purification Micro Column back into the collection tube.
Add 200 L of Prewash Buffer (supplemented with ethanol, see p. 3) to the DNA Purification Micro Column and centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000 g.
Discard the flow-through and place the purification column back into the collection tube.
Add 700 L of Wash Buffer (supplemented with ethanol, see p. 3) to the DNA Purification Micro Column and centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000 g.
Discard the flow-through and place the purification column back into the collection tube.
Repeat step 7 Centrifuge the empty DNA Purification Micro Column for an additional 1 minute at 14,000 g to completely remove residual Wash Buffer.
Transfer the DNA Purification Micro Column into a clean 1.8 mL microcentrifugetube Add 10 L of Elution Buffer to the DNA Purification Micro Column.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000 g to elute DNA.
