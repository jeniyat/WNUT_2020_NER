Electroporation Protocol
Turn on electroporator and set to 1.7-2.5 kv (optimize for strain), 200 ohms and 25 F.
Place recovery SOC in 37 C water bath.
Pre-warm LB-antibiotic plates at 37 C.
Thaw cells on ice for 10 min or use freshly made cells.
Place appropriate number of microcentrifuge tubes and 1 mm-electroporation cuvettes on ice.
Flick the tube containing cells a few times to mix and add 25 l to the microcentrifuge tubes.
Add 1 l of a 10 pg/ l DNA solution (in DI water) to the cells in the microcentrifuge tube.
Transfer the DNA-cell mixture to the cold cuvette, tap on countertop 2X, wipe water from exterior of cuvette and place in the electroporation module and press pulse (don t hold the button down).
Immediately add 975 l of 37 C SOC, mix by pipetting up and down once and transfer to a 15 ml-falcon tube.
Rotate in the 37 C incubator for 1 h.
Make appropriate dilutions.
Incubate overnight at 37 C.
