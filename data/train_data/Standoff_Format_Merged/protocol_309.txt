Probe Making
Cut a 5 inch length of carbon fiber tube, a 6 inch length of FEP outer sheath material, two inch pieces of inner end-cap material, and two inch pieces of middle end-cap material.
Place the inner end-cap material around the sample tube, slide up to an appropriate height so that there is enough space for the carbon-fiber tube below, and so that the overall sample tube length is correct, and shrink it on.
Shrink the middle end-cap material over the inner end-cap.
Slide the sample tube into the carbon fiber tube.
Similarly, shrink on inner and middle end-caps onto the sample tube below the carbon fiber.
Shrink a single piece of FEP sheath material over the whole assembly.
Cut the end on a slight angle.
