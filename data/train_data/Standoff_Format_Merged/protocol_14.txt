Western Blotting Protocol
Place cells in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge to collect the cell pellet.
Lyse the cell pellet with 100 l of lysis buffer on ice for 30 min (For 1 X 106 cells, lyse with 100 lof lysis buffer).
Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm (16,000 x g) for 10 minutes at 4 C.
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and discard the pellet.
Remove 20 l of supernatant and mix with 20 l of 2x sample buffer.
Boil for 5 min.
Cool at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Microcentrifuge for 5 minutes.
Load up to 40 l of sample to each well of a 1.5 mm thick gel.
Set gel running conditions according to the manufacturer s instructions.
Transfer the proteins to anitrocellulose or PVDF membrane with variable power settings according to the manufacturer s instructions.
Remove the blotted membrane from the transfer apparatus and immediately place in blocking buffer consisting of 5 % nonfat dry milk/TBS-T. Incubate the blot for 1 hour at room temperature, or overnight at 4 C with agitation.
Dilute the primary antibody to the recommended concentration/dilution in 5 % nonfat dry milk/TBS-T** (usually at 1 g/ml).
Place the membrane in the primary antibody solution and incubate for 2 hours at room temperature, or overnight at 4 C with agitation.
Wash for 5 minutes with Wash Buffer (TBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20).
[ wash 1/3 ].
Wash for 5 minutes with Wash Buffer (TBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20).
[ wash 2/3 ].
Wash for 5 minutes with Wash Buffer (TBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20).
[ wash 3/3 ].
Incubate the membrane for 30 minutes at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody, diluted to 1:1000 in 5 % nonfat dry milk/TBS T.
Wash for 10 minutes with TBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20.
(1/4).
Wash for 10 minutes with TBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20.
(2/4).
Wash for 10 minutes with TBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20.
(3/4).
Wash for 10 minutes with TBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20.
(4/4).
Wash once for 2 minutes with PBS.
Incubate membrane (protein side up) with 10 ml of ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence substrate) for 1-2 minutes.
The final volume required is 0.125 ml/cm2.
Drain off the excess detection reagent, wrap up the blots, and gently smooth out any air bubbles.
Place the wrapped blots, protein side up, in an X-ray film cassette and expose to x-ray film.
Exposures can vary from 5 seconds to 60 minutes.
