XIT Genomic DNA Blood Kit Protocol for Purificaton of DNA from Amniotic Fluid
Add 1 3ml Amniotic fluid to a 1.5ml centrifuge tube.
Centrifuge 14,000xg for 5 seconds then remove supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet.
Remove supernatant leaving 10 20 l residual liquid in the tube.
Vortex the tube to resuspend the cells in the residual liquid.
Add 400 l of XIT Lysis Buffer to the resuspended cells and vortex vigorously to lyse the cells.
Usually no incubation is required ; however, if cell clumps are visible after mixing, incubate at 37 C for 5 10 minutes or until the solution is homogenous.
Place the tube on ice for 1 minute to rapidly cool to room temperature.
Add 90 l XIT Protein Precipitation Buffer to the sample and mix by inverting the tube 10 20 times.
Centrifuge at 16,000g for 5 minutes.
Carefully, transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
Add 400 l isopropanol and 5 l Glycogen Solution to the supernatant and mix by gently inverting the sample at least 20 25 times.
Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes.
Discard the supernatant and use a pipette to carefully remove remaining liquid without disturbing the DNA pellet.
Add 200 l 70 % ethanol and invert the tube twice to wash the pellet.
Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes.
Discard the supernatant and drain the tube on a piece of clean absorbent paper.
Allow to air dry for 15 minutes.
Add 50 l TE buffer to dissolve the DNA.
Rehydrate the genomic DNA by incubating at 55 65 C for one hour.
Incubate overnight at room temperature to ensure complete genomic DNA hydration.
Store DNA at 4 C, for long term storage store at 20 or 80 C.
