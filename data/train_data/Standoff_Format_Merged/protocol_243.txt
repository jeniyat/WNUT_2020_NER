Qiagen QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (27104 or 27106) with a microcentrifuge
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 l Buffer P1 and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube.
Add 250 l Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4 6 times.
Add 350 l Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4 6 times.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.
Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
Centrifuge for 30 60 s.
Discard the flow-through.
Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30 60 s.
Discard the flow-through.
Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30 60 s.
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge at full speed for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Centrifuge for 1 min.
Let stand 1 minute.
Add 50 l buffer EB or water to the center of each QIAprep spin column.
Centrifuge 1-5mL bacterial overnight culture at > 6800g for 3 minutes at room temperature.
