Lysin purification protocol
Pellet 500ml cells (5min x 5000RPM).
Resuspend in 20ml MBBM, add 20 l tetracyline.
Add 150 l purified PBCV incubate 16hrs under fluorescent illumination with a 16 hr light/8 hr dark cycle at 25 C on an orbital shaker (~95 rpm).
Collect cells and virus by centrifugation at 25,000RPM (50.2Ti) for 17 min at 20 C.
Re-suspend cells in 20ml 25mM KOH, 50mM MOPS, 2mM Na2EGTA, 0.1M LiCl (pH 7) (wash).
Centrifuge 25,000RPM for 17 min at 20 C, discard supernatant.
Suspend pellet in 1.5ml 25mM KOH, 50mM MOPS (pH 7), 60 l 10M LiCl, 30 l 0.1M Na2EGTA incubate 50 min at 37 C.
Centrifuge 25,000RPM for 17 min at 20 C.
Collect supernatant (avoid DNA).
