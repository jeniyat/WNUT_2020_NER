Transformation of supercompetent cells
Inoculate two separate 1.5mls of LB medium with Invitrogen (Inv F ') cells.
Also include an uninoculated negative control tube.
Shake at 250 rpm overnight at 37 C.
Inoculate with 500ul of overnight E. coli culture two 50ml tubes each containing 25mls of sterile SOB media.
Shake at 250 rpm for 4 hours.
Ice the tubes of cells for 15 mins.
Pellet cells (approx 5 min spin, approx 3000 rpm) and discard supernatant.
Resuspend each pellet of cells in 8 mls of cold TFB by washing gently, then sucking up and down, with a wide-bore 10ml pipette tip.
Ice the tubes of cells for 15 mins.
Pellet cells (approx 5 min spin, approx 3000 rpm) and discard supernatant.
Resuspend one pellet of cells in 2 mls of cold TFB and use this liquid to resuspend the second pellet.
You should now have all cells in a single aliquot of 2mls cold TFB.
Add 105ul of DMSO swirl and ice for 5 mins.
Add 80ul of 100mM DTT, swirl, and ice for 10 mins.
Add 105ul of DMSO swirl and ice for 5 mins.
Aliquot 180ul of cells into pre-chilled, labelled 5ml polypropylene growth tubes with loose-cap lids.
Include positive and negative controls.
Add ligation DNA to each sample (in ~10ul volume) and ice for 30 mins.
Heat pulse tubes at exactly 42 C for exactly 90 secs.
Ice for 2 mins.
Add 400ul of 37 C SOC to each tube and incubate at 37 C for 10 mins.
Incubate a further 45 mins at 37 C shaking at 225 rpm.
Place tubes in ice to halt growth.
Transfer the cells from each tube to a labelled individual 1.5ml microfuge tube.
Give the microfuge tubes a very short (5 sec) spin to very loosely pellet the cells and then remove and discard 370ul of the supernatant.
Plate 40ul of the cell solution onto LB/ Amp+/ Xgal plates and grow overnight at 37 C
