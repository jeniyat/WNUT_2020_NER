Standard RNA Synthesis (E2050)
Thaw the necessary kit components.
Mix and pulse-spin in microfuge to collect solutions to the bottoms of tubes.
Keep on ice.
Assemble the reaction at room temperature in the following order.
Mix thoroughly and pulse-spin in a microfuge.
Incubate at 37 C for 2 hours.
Optional step : DNase treatment to remove DNA template.
To remove template DNA, add 30 l nuclease-free water to each 20 l reaction, followed by 2 l of DNase I (RNase-free), mix and incubate for 15 minutes at 37 C.
Proceed with purification of synthesized RNA or analysis of transcription products by gel electrophoresis.
