Glass Bead Transformation of Chlamydomonas
Grow cell culture to an OD750 of 0.15 to 0.4.
Centrifuge at 400g for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Resuspend in 1/100th the original volume of TAP.
Add the following : 8000, PEG to 5 % final conc., 3 ug of DNA, 0.3g of 500, micron glass beads 0.4mL, Chlamy cell suspension.
Mix with a pipette Vortex at max speed for 15 seconds.
Take 25uL of the cell suspension and add to 100uL of TAP with an appropriate antibiotic.
Spread on a TAP or YA plate, with an appropriate antibiotic, using large glass beads.
Allow the liquid to dry while avoiding light.
Seal the plates with parafilm.
Allow the colonies to grow (colonies will appear in 1-3 weeks).
Transfer the remaining cell/vortex culture to a 125mL flask with 20mL of TAP.
w/o antibiotic Incubate for 6 hours on an orbital shaker at 70rpm.
Add antibiotic to an appropriate concentration.
Take 50uL of the cell suspension and spread on a TAP or YA plate with an appropriate antibiotic with large glass beads
