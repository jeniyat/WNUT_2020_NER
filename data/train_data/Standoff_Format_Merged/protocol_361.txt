Modified KAPA Express Extract
Incubate in a thermocycler for 10 minutes at 75 C.
During this step, cells are lysed, nucleases and proteins degraded and DNA released.
Incubate for 5 minutes at 95 C to inactivate the thermostable KAPA Express Extract protease.
Vortex reaction product for 2-3 sec.
Centrifuge at high speed for 1 minute to pellet debris.Transfer DNA-containing supernatant to a fresh tube.
Use 1 l of DNA extract directly in a 25 l PCR, without quantification.
Dilute in TE Buffer for long-term storage at -20 C.
