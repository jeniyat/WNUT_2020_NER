Ligation Protocol WITH T4 DNA Ligase (M0202)
Thaw the T4 DNA Ligase Buffer and resuspended at room temperature.
Set up the reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice.
Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.
For cohesive (sticky) ends, incubate at 16 C overnight or room temperature for 10 minutes.
For blunt ends or single base overhangs, incubate at 16 C overnight or room temperature for 2 hours.
Heat inactivate at 65 degrees C for 10 minutes.
Chill on ice and transform 1-5 l of the reaction into 50 l competent cells.
