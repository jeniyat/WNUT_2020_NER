Bottle cleaning procedure for dissolved cobalt analyses
Obtain 60 mL narrow-mouth low density polyethylene bottles (LDPE) for this procedure.
Bottles are soaked for 10 days in the acidic detergent, Citranox, and rotated after approximately 5 days to make sure all sides of the bottles have been coated with soap.
The bottles are then rinsed thoroughly with Milli-Q water (usually 5 times, or until all soap is gone), and then filled with 10 % HCl (new HCl) to soak for 10 days (also being rotated after 5 days).
Each bottle is then rinsed thoroughly with pH 2 Milli-Q, and double-bagged and stored empty.
