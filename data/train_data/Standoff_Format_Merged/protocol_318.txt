DNA Extraction from sorted cells
Prepare 2x lysis buffer and add to the volume of sample so that its final concentration is 1x.
Filter-sterilize through 0.2 m.
Prepare 2x Lysis buffer with Lysozyme & RNase (1) : right before use add to 1 ml aliquot of lysis buffer :
Shake to dissolve thoroughly, then filter-sterilize again.
Dilute the 2x lysis buffer 1:1 with MQ water.
Weigh out minimum amount of ProtK, then add the appropriate amount of lysis buffer.
Filter sterilize again.
Add 1 volume of 2x Lysis buffer with Lysozyme & RNase to 1 volume of sorted cells.
Note down volumes and resulting volume V1.
Incubate at 37 C for 30 min, rotating end-over-end at angle (OR : in the shaking incubator @ 100 rpm, vertical), for optimal mixing with minimal frothing ; alternatively, shake vertically @ 100 rpm on shaking incubator and invert 10 times every 10 min.
Add V1*0.07 l of ProtK lysis buffer (2) to a final concentration of 0.65 mg/ml.
Note down volumes, including resulting volume V2.
Add V2/9 l of 10 % SDS to a final concentration of 1 %.
Note down volumes.
Incubate at 55 C for 2 hours, rotating end-over-end at angle (OR : in the shaking incubator @ 100 rpm, vertical ; invert every 20 min 10 times).
Add 600 l buffer AL (= buffer without the EtOH).
Mix thoroughly by vortexing.
Incubate at 70 C for 10 min (for heat block use 1.5 ml tubes!)
Add 600 l of 96-100 % EtOH Mix by vortexing vigorously.
Check pH of lysate, must be < 7 to get max. binding efficiency.
Pipette max. possible volume onto spin columns.
Spin 3 min at 8000xg ; discard flow-through.
Pipette additional lysate onto spin columns.
Spin 1 min at 8000xg ; discard flow-through and collection tube, transfer column to new collection tube.
Add 500 l of buffer
AW1 Spin 2 min at 8000xg ; discard flow-through.
Add 500 l of buffer.
AW2 Spin 3 min at 8000xg ; discard flow-through and collection tube, To dry columns, spin at 8000xg for 3 min.
Discard potential flow-through ; transfer column to new collection tube.
Add 200 l pre-heated 70 C buffer AE or water.
Incubate 1 min at room temp.
Spin at 8000xg for 2 min to elute.
Repeat with second 200 l.
Transfer eluted DNA to the Amicon Ultra 30 K.
Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 10 min.
Rinse DNA with 500 l PCR water.
Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 10 min.
Add 20 l dilute TE, pipette up and down 20 times and transfer to clean tube for storage.
Centrifuge at 1000xg for 3 min upside down, in fresh tube to retrieve (Optional : repeat with another 20 l to ensure all retrieved)
