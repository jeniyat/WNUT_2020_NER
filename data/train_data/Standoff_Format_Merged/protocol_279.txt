Dephosphorylation using rSAP in Restriction Enzyme Reaction (M0371)
Digest 1 5 g of plasmid DNA in a 20 l reaction as follows : Incubate at 37 C for 60 minutes or follow manufacturer s recommendations.
Add 1 unit of rSAP for every 1 pmol of DNA ends (about 1 g of a 3 kb plasmid).
Incubate at 37 C for 30 60 minutes.
Stop reaction by heat-inactivation of rSAP and restriction enzyme (follow manufacturer 's recommendations).
