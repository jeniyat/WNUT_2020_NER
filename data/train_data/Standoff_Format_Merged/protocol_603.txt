Obtaining pure cyanophage stocks (plaque purification).
Make a dilution series of the lysate (assume 104 to 105 PFU per mL in the plaque lysate).
Repeat the plaque purification procedure 2 more times to ensure that the cyanophage isolated is clonal.
Repeat the plaque purification procedure again.
Finally, prepare a primary cyanophage stock using lysate from the final purification via method A `` Liquid Amplification '' OR method B `` Plate Amplification '' Method A : liquid amplification Method B : plate amplification Titer the final stock via plaque assay.
Cyanophage stocks stored at 4 C in the dark are stable for at least a year.
