EPPS recipe for dissolved cobalt analyses
Weigh out 22 g of EPPS directly into a 200 mL trace metal clean bottle.
Add 173 mL of Milli-Q to the bottle by weight using an analytical balance.
Make sure the EPPS is fully dissolved, and then pass the EPPS solution through an HPLC column packed with Chelex-100 resin into a trace metal clean bottle.
