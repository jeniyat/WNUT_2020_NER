Checking DNA Concentration with Agarose Gel
Prepare 0.7 % agarose.
Post-stain with SYBR Gold.
While the gel is cooling, prepare samples : 1 l of 10x loading buffer per 10 l of sample.
Prepare the appropriate dilutions of the appropriate marker (commonly 10ng of HINDIII [ lambda ] DNA).
Add running buffer to cover gel.
Gently rock the comb before pulling it out.
Run at 50V about 2-4 hours to get clean band separations.
Post-stain the gel in SYBR Gold bath (20ul SYBR : 200ml TAE for 30 minutes).
Compare gel quantification to that obtained using Nanodrop to get a feeling for how clean the DNA prep is.
