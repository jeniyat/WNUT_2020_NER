Plaque Assay Protocol for Pseudoalteromonas. 	
First, autoclave the top agar to melt it. 
While the autoclave is running: 
a. Let your plates warm to room temperature and label them 
b. Make whatever dilutions of your phages you plan to plate. 
Aliquot the agar into tubes and place in 40°C water bath.   
Pipet 100 μl of your phage sample onto the plate.  
Remove the agar tube from the water bath and add the host to it.   
Add 3.5 ml of the agar/host mixture. 
Swirl each plate to spread the agar as you go. 
Leave the plates on the bench overnight. 
Count or pick plaques the next day.
